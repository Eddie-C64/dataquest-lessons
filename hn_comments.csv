I also enjoy the potential connections to other Bronze Age oddities like the Trondheim Sun Chariot and the Nebra Sky Disk:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trundholm_sun_chariot" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trundholm_sun_chariot</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nebra_sky_disk" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nebra_sky_disk</a><p>But if I had to be totally honest I found this while researching the history of wizard hats and that&#x27;s what I like the most about it. Granted there&#x27;s almost certainly no link there but it&#x27;s fun to imagine a scenario whereby Bronze Age proto-druid ceremonial headgear leads to Gandalf&#x27;s hat.

0,My 2 cents on this.<p>You need to think ahead a bit on how you might use the user management layer down the line. Even if you decide to move away from XYZ service that you started with you need to at some point replicate all the functionality that made you want to go with them in the first case. Ideally your best bet is to use this kind of service for as long as you can to minimize service disruption to your users. As you pointed out &quot;A dedicated third party company is going to do this better than me.&quot;<p>A better approach IMO is to go for an authentication service that is flexible for a longer term and satisfies your core requirements today (ie user management functions). The payment stuff is anyway custom (as the nature of your plans are unique to your business) and can be easily achieved a 3rd party platform where the user layer is integrated via OAuth.<p>One simple approach here is to use Wordpress with WooCommerce (ready packages exist) as your &quot;sales&quot; layer + an integration module to Stormpath&#x2F;Auth0&#x2F;etc to sync the user auth layer. This is a solved problem for Wordpress sites and you just need to link it to an OAuth layer that does what you need. I get that you don&#x27;t want to write any code but no two businesses are alike especially in the subscriptions game and you&#x27;re better off spending a little time to get this setup the way you want instead of having to live with what someone else gives you.<p>We just went through a similar exercise and this is the understanding we arrived at. We&#x27;re using Auth0 (www.auth0.com) instead of Stormpath as we plan to deploy quite a few micro-apps linked to a single login and we don&#x27;t want to be charged by the number of apps we have but by our user volume. Otherwise the service feature-sets are quite similar.<p>Hope this helps.<p>P.S We&#x27;re using ChargeBee (www.chargebee.com) to handle our subscription billing management and we&#x27;re writing some minors scripts to automate our user layer based on the payment status.

(A couple of different ones because I like to segregate them by criticality. So I don&#x27;t have to unlock the one with critical information most of the time. Reduces the attack surface.)<p>I can access them anywhere. Although I try not to access them on anything I don&#x27;t have control over. For example: I memorize my dropbox password and my student login separately.<p>And it&#x27;s a whole lot more secure to have a couple of long passphrases to unlock long generated passphrases for every site than to have a short password&#x2F;passphrase for every site.

0,&gt; Can&#x27;t even think that I have read any stories (so far) about malware having an impact on auto operation. Hard to believe that opening up the software won&#x27;t result in something bad happening either.<p>First of all it would be EXTREMELY hard to nail down a car crash to malware currently because we have no tools&#x2F;insight to do so. For all we know (put&#x27;s on tinfoil hat) car hacking has been employed multiple times by state actors to kill off people who they disagree with. It&#x27;s way too easy to write it off a the driver made a mistake and never have an investigation into the root cause.<p>However we HAVE seen that it&#x27;s possible to hack into a car there are multiple news articles showing people taking over control of cars remotely and killing the breaks shutting off the engine pushing down the accelerator etc.<p>Also I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;Safety&quot; argument it&#x27;s way to easy to scream &quot;Think of the children&quot; to kill off an argument. Hobbyist hackers who want to hack their own cars have to still abide by the laws set out by the government just like a mechanic can&#x27;t put a car on the road without breaks. I don&#x27;t see the difference yes maybe it will make it easier for bad hackers to disable your breaks but they could just cut the break line which would probably be easier (or should be if the automakers take security seriously at all which I would bet they don&#x27;t).

0,Hi everyone! Blinkenlights is a fun side-project app I made to be able to quickly see the status of anything you can dream up. I am obsessed with blinking status lights on hardware devices so I used that as inspiration for a status dashboard UI. The app uses an open JSON protocol to drive the lights and it&#x27;s defined here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blinkenlights-api.jazzychad.net&#x2F;spec.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blinkenlights-api.jazzychad.net&#x2F;spec.html</a> - the app comes with several example lights and registries for the S&amp;P 500 stocks to show their change during the trading day. But you can create your own using the protocol above and if you want you can contribute to the community registry so that others can use your lights. I also added the ability for people to manually add registries (e.g. if a company wanted to publish a list of lights internally for business-related statuses). Give it a try! I&#x27;ll be adding more types of output displays over time.

But if the DIVs are formatted properly then it&#x27;s usually not that hard to find the matching start tag. As for the class in the closing tag that&#x27;s what my statement about people putting comments with the closing tag is referring to. It&#x27;s been done and was quite popular at one time. I&#x27;m willing to bet our editing tools fixed that problem simply by highlighting matching element pairs.<p>But in the end if HTML went with &lt;div&gt;&lt;&#x2F;&gt; instead of &lt;div&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; then I probably wouldn&#x27;t mind so much. But I can&#x27;t agree that no closing tag is more readable because it takes less space that makes no sense. It might look better.<p>I would be curious about bandwidth savings but I&#x27;m willing to bet in most cases it would make very little difference.

Because they are being themselves and are connected to the natural wellspring of motivation that comes from genuine interest while you are the salmon swimming upstream aping societal ideals and trying to be someone you are not.<p>The quote assumes that your peers are focusing all of their energy on being themselves.

Pedestrians can be very unpredictable and they don&#x27;t tend to signal very clearly what they are about to do not to mention that a pedestrian can stop or turn around pretty much instantly.<p>The optimal solution is of course to build dedicated bike lanes but if that&#x27;s not a option I&#x27;d rather ride my bike on the road with other cars than on a shared path with pedestrians. It&#x27;s also a matter of attitude roads are built to allow cars to travel between point A and point B as fast as possible. If cycling is to be seen as a form of transportation they also need to have access to proper infrastructure.

0,Western religions (various forms of Christianity) formed under hundreds of years of virtual and real slavery conditions. The Roman empire wasn&#x27;t exactly the friendliest place to live if you were an outsider. Therefore a big part of the belief system is the value of the individual. IIRC Christianity was one of the first belief systems to suggest that all people _were_ actually people: up until then &quot;people&quot; was just part of whichever clan you were in. Other folks were sub-human.<p>So the real question in regards to both abortion and embryo hacking is how much value we place on other humans -- humans of a different color humans that are babies humans that disagree with us. Do we treat them as we would want to be treated? Or are they basically disposable?<p>I&#x27;m not a religious person and the theology gets very complicated but it&#x27;s not simply a matter of &quot;religion says this must be bad so I will reject all science and progress!&quot; Folks on both sides of this discussion tend to over-simplify the positions of the others. Didn&#x27;t believe you were doing that but I felt the discussion could use a little more clarification.

Keep in mind that I did have prior experience with C# .NET and Visual Studio.<p>As far as &quot;recommendations on developing for multiple mobile platforms&quot; I&#x27;d be happy to answer slightly more specific questions.<p>&gt; As far as I understand it if you are big and have the resources your best bet is still to develop separate native apps for each platform.<p>If you have different teams for each platform it makes sense to go native and duplicate the effort. As soon as you want to share code or resources (including employees) between more than one platform Xamarin starts making sense. If you have a small mobile development team (1-2 people) you&#x27;ll probably need to either pick a single platform or go with Xamarin. If you plan to have a Windows app Xamarin makes sense. If the business is already using Microsoft technologies (Windows .NET C# Visual Studio TFS or even Typescript) then Xamarin makes a lot of sense.<p>However Xamarin is not a silver bullet. It does comes with some trade-offs (in addition to those mentionned in the article).<p>- You still need a Mac (either as your main machine or on the network).<p>- Compile time is a bit slower.<p>- You don&#x27;t get access to the latest Android SDK on day one (you do with iOS though).<p>- You can&#x27;t use any existing iOS&#x2F;Android libraries out of the box. Someone (which could be you) need to manually &quot;bind&quot; the Java&#x2F;Objective-C library interface to C# first.<p>- Application startup time might be a bit longer on iOS.

0,There are differences between Hank in Adria.<p>* Hank did a private joke while Adria took the issue to the public (tweeted to her 10000 followers)* Hank was a developer while Adria was a developer evangelist so she officially represents the company publicly. It&#x27;s important to note that a lof of her Twitter followers probably followed her because of her position at Sendgrid.<p>Which is why I can understand Sendgrid&#x27;s decision but less Hank&#x27;s employer&#x27;s decision. Not based on the blackmail but because it became hard for such a dividing personality to assume a position that involves public communication with a developer community that may or may not agree with everything you think.

Why you go back to it and give it even more money of course! What else <i>could</i> be the solution? A national enforcement of open formats to ensure everything is nice and compatible? No that&#x27;s just crazy talk. Decades-old beholding to a single monopolistic company sounds so much easier...just embrace it.

(I.e. not an empty project).You can also start a project from a git&#x2F;github source and so on.<p>It seems to be heavily broken right now or heavily unstable. Hmpf...I&#x27;m trying to start the ipython notebook (you have to do this ondemand) then you can start editing the files ... but it is stuck. Nowit&#x27;s completely broken.<p>The terminal works fine now and a project is running in some kind ofisolated container in beefy linux ubuntu 14.04 running under a common&quot;sense&quot; user (which is the only user).They are also running some node.js client and their &quot;butterfly&quot; server.<p>Ok well I tried to test it further or add a collaborator butthe website just says &quot;502 application not responding&quot;.<p>It didn&#x27;t seem like they have real-time editing or LaTeX.<p>few more details. ... now it runs fine again. two screenshotsattached. ... one is the project view the other one the &quot;workbench&quot;.<p>They run a plain &quot;R&quot; terminal but with a neat HTML output. It&#x27;s avertically split editor where the .r file is on the left and you canselect lines of text which are then executed via &quot;ctrl+return&quot;. That&#x27;sexactly how those R people work (instead of having cells like ipythonor sagews)<p>The same for python files: one or all lines are fed into the &quot;ipythonterminal&quot; not the notebook (!) and then translated to some htmloutput on the right. plots work fine etc.<p>So on the right of the screenshots you can see the copies of the input lines.<p>By default they add a .gitconfig file with the username and emailaddress. That&#x27;s cool and I guess this could be done for SMC as well.<p>There is no auto-save for files just lost the content.<p>-- William Stein and Harald Schilly

0,While we don&#x27;t disclose our full list of final diagnoses I can give you some statistics from our 700+ cases resolved to date:<p>-- no single diagnosis is more than 2% of the total except for one (Lyme disease at 2.3%)-- 95% of these have come up as final diagnoses only once or twice in the history of the site<p>So it&#x27;s fair to say that it&#x27;s a VERY long-tail list. Also:<p>-- our current success rate is 70% (i.e. the patient told us that we brought them closer to a correct diagnosis or cure)-- about 50% of our final diagnoses are medically confirmed by the patient&#x27;s doctor<p>These statistics are based on our post-case surveys which not all of our patients answer but they should be directionally accurate.

0,&gt; If your argument isn&#x27;t &quot;well you don&#x27;t need new syntax and help from the compiler if you just pay attention and remember not to use with&#x2F;try if you ever need guaranteed tail calls&quot; then please state it more clearly because I haven&#x27;t understood it.<p>To clarify: Yes I believe that whichever stack release semantic is chosen (tailcall optimization or the current behaviour) triggers an understanding of its limitation. Languages that support tailcalls natively yield programmers that &quot;see&quot; tailcalls (so they don&#x27;t think about it more than necessary) and non-tailcall support yield programmers that &quot;see&quot; stack allocation on recursion (but they don&#x27;t think about the stack more than tailcall programmers do.)<p>Now we both like the &quot;default&quot; behaviour that we have practised the most because we really understand its limitation. When confronted with the other semantic we can make it work but it&#x27;s slower to trigger our reflexes and causes frustration:<p>A tailcall programmer forced to use a non tail-call language will have to &quot;compile&quot; his tail recursion into a loop. A non-tailcall programmer forced to use a tailcall language will gain free stack but won&#x27;t have to rewrite his algorithm.

In conclusion he proposes various taxes and other transfers to reduce inequality. Although the history and theory seems plausible I&#x27;m not completely sold on the effectiveness of the inequality measures although I&#x27;m sure that you and Piketty have your reasons to disagree with me. I doubt <i>much more</i> that those measures would reduce the occurrence of M&amp;Z&amp;B rather than just taxing them a bit more once they&#x27;ve done <i>really</i> well for themselves.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s unfortunate that the downvotes have chased &#x27;logicallee from the arena.

0,Last summer when I was an intern I totally bought the hackathon culture. Then I went to one and was absolutely appalled at what goes on inside hackathons. Big talks about the next cool app and raising money from VC coz I went to Y school and know Z. One of the apps that won was a chat app for hackers in 2014. There were some good people too but they were hard to find and very few. Since then I have started moving away from the so-called hacker culture and just ignore hackathons. Fundamentally the whole concept of hackathon just sounds bad to me now. You code and don&#x27;t sleep or sleep in some random place at random time. I would take good sleep any day over learning some fancy new technology. I would prefer hackathons to be more where a set of people show something interesting they have built and then people can discuss merits&#x2F;demerits and start contributing to them. Sprints of open source projects comes to mind. The likes scikit-learn under python for example.

0,I&#x27;ll try to share some examples in a bit. Short reason this approach is &quot;lossy&quot;: it&#x27;s a huge game of telephone. Translation retains most of the translated concept but not all of the concept&#x27;s subtleties. The farther removed we get from the original the less faithful the translation. We see this most clearly where it takes a paragraph of English to start to communicate the meaning contained in one word from some languages.<p>Simple example: translate <i>namaste</i> into one English word.<p>I come at this from a context of living in Alaska and seeing firsthand the value of language retention and the tragedy of language loss. I&#x27;ve also had great benefit from digging into other cultures&#x27; world views and each of those experiences was heavily dependent on paying attention to the nuances of older languages. These concepts are hard to grasp if this whole topic is approached from a strictly academic context.

I like to toy with the idea living forever or at least hundreds of years...<p>But looking at our society now. As the average lifespan getting higher more people stay in jobs longer as usual. The young wont have any jobs because their parent will stay in the positions. In the end the old would have to sustain the young and soon after that no one would want to have a child because who needs another hungry mouth.<p>Of course as the 1st world country citizens will afford living a longer life 2nd and 3rd ones wont.This will create a massive gap between nations. Like we didn&#x27;t have that already.<p>And we don&#x27;t know how the human mind could handle this anyway. Maybe you would go actually mad after 200 years of living.<p>And as I said. The extra years always add up to the end. Maybe you live 200 years but 2&#x2F;3 of that is spent being old and useless.<p>As highly appreciated and acknowledged people warn us about the ramifications of A.I. so we should be extremely cautious about banning death.<p>To be honest I would be less afraid of A.I. as the consequences of immortality.

Netflix DVDs are in awful shape and waits for the &quot;long tail&quot; disks are insane.<p>I really can&#x27;t get behind the online rentals because they feel like Blockbuster-style ripoffs. At the same time that I can rent a new release from Redbox for $1.50 streaming wants to charging $4 for the exact same show.<p>Public library inter-library requests are becoming the only answer anymore but it&#x27;s so much freaking friction. And the local public library late fee policies here would make 90&#x27;s Blockbuster look like saints...<p>And I&#x27;m getting really really tired of the Netflix streaming new releases being exactly the same movies that are concurrently playing free on the HDTV subchannel broadcasts (ThisTV BounceTV etc) or on Crackle. Netflix doesn&#x27;t have commercials whoopee I guess. That&#x27;s only an issue because stupid streaming sites don&#x27;t allow ad fastforwards (which a DVR handles wonderfully)<p>And while I&#x27;m ranting who at Sony thought that anyone pushing the eject button on a Bluray player wants to stand around twiddling their thumbs while the player mines a bitcoin block or whatever it&#x27;s doing before spitting out the tray?

0,(from memory there are some design docs for Qubes OS floating around that discuss this) Xen is relatively small and contained KVM sits on top of a full Linux kernel and potentially can access all of it making it harder to tell what is accessible&#x2F;exploitable and what is not. KVM also uses Qemu running as a process on the host linux for interfacing the VM again exposing more potential attack surface. And I think Xen is better at isolating drivers which for Qubes OS is a fundamental principle.

0,I played around with this a few years back when looking at build tools. strace is ungodly slow and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for anything real. When I looked into why it&#x27;s basically the time it takes to print and read from strace - printing to stdout every time there is a syscall is obviously very slow.<p>Instead you can use tup though someone mentioned it now requires Fuse which obviously isn&#x27;t good. So instead you can use an LD_PRELOAD to record all the file accesses which is what I think tup used to do.<p>There is also some filesystem thing added to git that let&#x27;s introspect file access though I don&#x27;t recall the details.<p>That said I think memoize is the first use of this technique (record actual file accesses dynamically for dependency tracking) which is utterly genius. I worked with Bill McCloskey who wrote it and he is an incredibly smart dude. He did a lot of work on making Firefox&#x27;s GC better over the last few years.

0,10Q&#x27;s are very strange docs though as they&#x27;re mostly written with lawsuit mitigation in mind. So you name nearly everyone and everything as a potential competitor just in case one of them actually does become one one day.<p>But you raise a good point. I think the insecurity starts with Google and Apple responds. (and I&#x27;m an Android user so no fanboi assumptions!) Google relies on a very open web to leverage all the data to optimize search to drive ad monetization. I think Apple was very happy with optimized Google services running on iPhones making the whole experience richer (they want to sell hardware not profit from search&#x2F;ads) Once Google realized just what mobile would become and how big a chunk of that Apple would control they panicked at the <i>thought</i> of being locked out. Again due to their basic premise they&#x27;re always going to be more insecure.

Chrome&#x2F;Windows cannot display anything except first and second-to-last lines IE and FF work fine though.<p>You could instead use combining characters (\u20dd \u20df) to decorate any unicode char but the number of fonts supporting this feature is extremely limited. One such font is Cambria on Windows but spaces should be used to properly center a char inside enclosing mark (&lt;char&gt; + space + \u20dd) [1]. I wonder if a font exists which fully supports combining chars and contains metrics for centering them.<p>[1] <a href="http://jsbin.com/cuxogojivo/2/edit?htmlcssoutput" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsbin.com&#x2F;cuxogojivo&#x2F;2&#x2F;edit?htmlcssoutput</a>

This would be a job for hitting CLRS.<p>This seems like something most people could come up with to start as it seems pretty obvious but a single graph theory course I took some years ago must have biased me a bit.

Xiaomi badly wants&#x2F;wanted to be Apple. What they did with Android might look creative to you but only if you look at it as an Android. Again they want to be Apple. They want to have an iOS modifying Android is the fastest way to get there.<p>To all the people saying Xiaomi is just taking inspiration - watch that:<a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XODc0OTA0NzY4.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;v.youku.com&#x2F;v_show&#x2F;id_XODc0OTA0NzY4.html</a><p>I think we just have hard time stomaching the fact that people who blatantly plagiarize can win.

0,I&#x27;ve just started working with the new AWS CLI and while in the long term I will probably switch to using boto directly from Python for now I process the CLI&#x27;s JSON output in bash scripts.  Using structured data in this way is really quite interesting.  Because it isn&#x27;t sensitive to whitespace or newline mangling the JSON output can safely be stored in an environment variable a la Perl (e.g. ```VAR=$(aws ... -output json)```).  Rather than hacking up some rudimentary parsing using sed&#x2F;awk&#x2F;etc. I can pipe it to an existing parser (e.g. jshon) which will extract the data I want with minimal effort.  I think that if I had an objection to XML it isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s structured but because it&#x27;s so verbose relative to simpler serialization formats like JSON or YAML.  Then again I don&#x27;t know why we even bother with those when we&#x27;re just a tiny bit of syntax away from sexps.  :)

I expect that it will be fascinating to compare the two projects as each matures.

0,One thing worth saying here is that Git is now the dominant player in the source control market. According to almost every survey I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s overtaken Subversion (according to some reports by a fairly large margin) not only for open source and hobbyists but in the enterprise as well. It&#x27;s more or less become a lingua franca for communicating source code between teams these days as well as being the preferred deployment option for many cloud hosting providers and even some package managers. No other source control system has ever managed that.<p>As such you simply can&#x27;t afford not to know it these days. In fact I can&#x27;t help thinking that not using Git should now be a major red flag for job candidates and prospective employers alike. Sure not using your favourite tool may not be that big a deal but not using what is to all intents and purposes the lingua franca of source code communication is a serious omission.

In the cases you&#x27;ve mentioned you could create a simple wrapper function to deal with it for you.<p>I guess there&#x27;s some reason for using bytes instead of strings as the output to the interface but as you say it&#x27;s definitely non-obvious.<p>There are lots of things that are a little different in python 3; I would say overwhelmingly for the better on the whole. There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be much point fighting against those minor changes when they&#x27;re easy enough to adapt to.

0,There are a lot of meanings for &quot;success.&quot;  I think that Apple Watch will sell comfortably well at launch.  Apple has earned brand loyalty from its customers and is adept at gauging or generating demand and selling to it.<p>And having the watch my sense is that the overwhelming majority of Watch-owners will you know where and use it.  Nothing I&#x27;m getting from any of these reviews is &quot;oh my god this is a disaster&quot; and the people I know who have Pebbles or Android Wear watches like them pretty well and continue to wear them.  This suggests that once you&#x27;ve shelled out for a smartwatch the watch has to be pretty bad for you to just not use it.<p>Now:  will people who bought the watch like it enough to want to upgrade it regularly?  Will they evangelize it to their friends?  Will they drive demand for apps that creates a robust app ecosystem and potentially clever new products that are uniquely suited to the watch form-factor?<p>I don&#x27;t think they will.  Which has little to do with Apple per se and more to do with the inherent limitations of the form factor.  But if I&#x27;m right (and hey I&#x27;m predicting the future I&#x27;m probably wrong) that&#x27;s not good news for Apple which more than Google really needs the watch to be successful.

0,Your argument sounds semi-reasonable.<p>It&#x27;s not though. Everyone hates the USA by now and that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re spying on everyone (even allies) they think they can tell everyone what to do else they use their military to intervene.<p>The USA is currently the world bully. For the military aggression hopefully Americans will at some point realize that fighting the world can only end in tears - the USA is drained financially and simultaneously breeding new terrorists through the drone war which should be classified a war crime as there is no telling how many innocents have been killed.<p>Karma&#x27;s a bitch friends. This is how empires fall.<p>Really the USA needs to re-evaluate its foreign policy. Spend half the military budget for 2015 that&#x27;s $300Bn on education and hospitals and bingo you&#x27;re once again the #1 nation in the world.<p>Then instead of making war everywhere make friends and trade partners and watch the money pour in the soldiers stay home and stay alive. Fight terrorists with gestures of goodwill and they will go away all on their own - as opposed to killing random children in Pakistan so their fathers uncles and other relatives may justifiably become new terrorists with a life-long grudge against the USA.<p>And tell the NSA to focus on defense - keep out the baddies keep out the Chinese and Russian hackers keep American businesses and business interests safe stop others from hacking in the USA. But don&#x27;t go out and listen to everyone&#x27;s phone calls and hack allies and enemies alike and have secret laws like the Nazis did - because honestly all that shit will get back to you eventually. Do something bad - somebody will find out. That&#x27;s the new reality we live in all facts will be discovered.<p>That Kaspersky was able to uncover the most sophisticated hacker group in the world is a case in point. The internet is the perfect paper trail no matter how good you are.<p>The ostensibly noble good goals that secret laws and secret operations supposedly lead up to never materialize. The ends that the means supposedly justify never arrive. So keep the means good keep it clean. This whole idea that you must deceive cheat and betray in order to survive is a wrong idea and it&#x27;s proven again and again until the lesson is learned. Your choice when to learn it.<p>Karma is a bitch friends.

More precisely it’s always impossible to measure “color” because color is a perception in the brain not a physical fact about the environment.<p>But it’s certainly possible to make a good guess at the light source by looking at objects in the scene. In this particular case we can look at the black and white dress at bottom left which we can reasonably expect will appear neutral to human eyes and most “properly white balanced” camera images.<p>I’ll agree that the camera used here has a relatively crummy sensor &#x2F; processing pipeline though.

0,I worked remotely from Tahiti for a few months. It was an amazing experience that I&#x27;ll always cherish. Now I just need to convince my new boss to let me do this again somewhere else.<p>For those of you in the pacific time zone (sf bay). If you&#x27;re interested in doing this I recommend Tahiti or Hawaii. It&#x27;s three hours off from pacific time during the summer months but only 2 hours off during winter. You can easily work a local time of 6-3 which would be 8-5 in PT. This gives you the rest of the day to enjoy paradise.<p>A tip on how to convince your boss to let you do this: Plan to go on a two week vacation somewhere. When asking for time off ask your boss if they mind you working remotely for a couple weeks following your vacation. It might just work--and like in my case I found out that my boss didn&#x27;t care if I stayed longer.

0,Spotify&#x27;s &quot;all you can listen to&quot; model inherently implies they&#x27;re going to be used as background music.<p>Could be worse. They could have their own musicians record popular songs and classics and just pay the statutory royalty to the composer.  Seeburg did that in the 1950s.[1] They sold the Seeburg 1000 background music system and rented out phonograph records of background music all recorded by Seeburg musicians.  Stores rented and serviced the simple record changer which endlessly played a stack of 25 records (both sides) about 50 hours of music. It&#x27;s not a jukebox; it&#x27;s much simpler.<p>Instead of copyrighting the disks (back then you had to register a copyright and pay for renewals) they used a primitive form of DRM - the records are 16 2&#x2F;3 RPM 9 inch diameter 2 inch center hole 0.005&quot; stylus width mono.  This is incompatible with everything except a Seeburg 1000 though it&#x27;s not hard to adapt a turntable to play them.<p>Someone has digitized the available Seeburg 1000 records and you can listen to about 6000 songs of &#x27;50s - 70s background music.<p>[1] <a href="http://radiocoast.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;radiocoast.com&#x2F;</a>

0,This is the most important question in this thread (though it was worded confusingly). There was a statistically discernible difference but what is the <i>magnitude</i> of that difference?<p>The reddit thread[0] on this paper has a lot of nonsense but also has people with actual access to the paper. One informative comment (keeping in mind this study was done only on people who already identified as gluten sensitive):<p>&gt; <i>31 of the individuals had an equal response to gluten or placebo a further 13 had no significant difference. 5 individuals had stronger negative effects to placebo 9 had stronger effects to Gluten. The three mentioned were over 2 standard deviations above the mean and hence considered to be sensitive.</i><p>&gt; <i>There did appear to be a general increase across the board for symptoms however the one caveat that was reported in results but not discussed was the fact that individuals report worse symptoms (p=0.009) in the first week of the trial compared to the second.</i><p>&gt; <i>There were also no individual symptoms that showed a significant difference between the placebo and gluten. Only when all symptoms were combined as a sum did they have a difference.</i><p>[0] <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2x844y/randomized_doubleblind_placebocontrolled_trial/coxt7iw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;science&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2x844y&#x2F;randomized_...</a>

0,I&#x27;ve done a few online tests recently and I was thinking of how to do a better one.<p>1) The main idea was to have the results of unit tests visible live. I&#x27;ve done a few tests where I found out I didn&#x27;t get through even though the test rig says it works. It compiles it gets the examples right but there&#x27;s some hidden test that failed. You&#x27;ll never know why even though it&#x27;s probably not something surprising.<p>So just make it explicit. A bunch of lights for each test a description of what the test is and there you go.<p>2) That solves little problems like &quot;given some set of numbers how do I find some ridiculous property of those numbers?&quot; type questions.<p>What you really need is something that tells you how people deal with complexity. I have a large problem how do I solve it? There&#x27;s always more than one right answer.<p>Here you might be better off doing some kind of subjective voting. People who are looking for work might find it comforting that other people in their situation are judging them. Or gratifying to be able to judge other people&#x27;s skills. Perhaps there&#x27;s some incentive structure that cleverly aligns this.

Try turning any bootstrap template with their 10+ nested levels of tags into the syntax you propose and then try moving things around in the editor finding the right spot to append an element when all you see is something like )))))))) that would be crazy hard to do without errors. To make that work we would first need some kind of function syntax so that deep nested blocks can be simplified.

My take on this is the following:<p>The problem of someone using another person in a cruel and harsh manner will not be solved until you resolve the problem of massive power differentials in society. In general when a man has money&#x2F;power equal to the next 100000 people (literally worth 100000 times more than the next person in our capitalistic language) why on earth wouldn&#x27;t he think he can use this 1&#x2F;100000th of a person for his personal satisfaction? It is functionally no different than eating chicken.<p>The problem is not one of gender but one of power. The solution is NOT to see women differently but to make society so that no person (or employer let&#x27;s not forget the huge power differential between an employee and employer) is worth so many more times another person that it warps their view of the other&#x27;s worth.<p>Can we bring back labor unions already?

0,&gt; That&#x27;s a bastardisation of loyalty though. Yes people volunteer because they are expected to.<p>It is pretty clear that you have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.  You know that you can dislike people in general but still recognize positive qualities right?  Here is another example: Sergeant Major Bradley Kasal.  This guy used his own body as a bullet stop to protect his Marines nobody expects that.<p>&gt; What about speaking up about a situation that is going to get people killed?<p>There was a lot of that we got it shut down at the eleventh hour.<p>&gt; What about the people who didn&#x27;t volunteer where they fine with the whole thing as long as they weren&#x27;t affected?<p>I didn&#x27;t poll everybody but I&#x27;m pretty confident in saying that nobody was fine with the situation.  At lot of those guys were pretty torn between loyalty to their families the guys that they&#x27;d just been in combat with and their fellow Marines in the artillery battalion.  There were many private conversation had were they tried to talk volunteers out of it and more than one anonymous letter to a General.<p>&gt; Is the commander visiting his guys after years and year when they are dealing with PTSD?<p>Do you think that is practical?  In their careers they will have commanded thousands of men.  There is a strong bond though for example: another personal story :)  When I got out of the Corps I drove all the way across the country for a job in DC.  After a few days of searching I found a basement apartment for rent - the landlord lived upstairs with his wife and toddler daughter.  Purely by chance the landlord was a Colonel in the USMC and he instantly treated me like an old family friend - standing invitation to dinner long conversation on the porch etc.  The wife was not a big fan of this and I&#x27;m pretty sure my new buddy was constantly catching hell for it.  Until one day several months later when I came home from work and found the front door wide open and heard panicked footsteps inside.  Now this was in pretty much the worst part of DC and I could have easily just made my way to my private entrance and ignored the possibility that the landlord was getting burgled.  Instead I began clearing the house room by room - armed with a paring knife from the kitchen.  I gave the cleaning lady quite a shock she had forgotten the alarm code and was rushing around trying to find it.  I was sure that I&#x27;d get the boot for that but instead I got a dinner invitation from the wife.  The cleaning lady informed her of what happened and it suddenly clicked for her - I was family.<p>&gt; The military selectively decides what part of these virtues that are valued.<p>Again spoken like somebody who has no idea what they&#x27;re talking about.  Outside of the philosophy department in college I&#x27;ve never seen an organization focus as much on morality as the USMC.  Of course the perspective is that of the state.  So any flaws you find in the logic of military morality will be rooted in the state not the military.

Conversely the function can throw if another part of the program keeps too many files open.

Or my parents refusing to use Apple Pay because their details can apparently be stolen. Or people disabling Touch ID because it can be broken into. Or people disabling iCloud backups because of some privacy article they read (and then losing all of their photos of their children). Or frankly people staying on a crappy Windows laptop because they read something about Apple&#x27;s software quality declining.<p>I don&#x27;t care about Apple&#x27;s bank balance or stock price. But as someone who loves tech and thinks that tech can improve people&#x27;s day-to-day lives I want my family and friends to make informed decisions about which tech to buy and whether it&#x27;ll help them. Not worrying that their Apple Watch will give them cancer.

Plus I&#x27;d be amazed if they ever managed to show an ad I was remotely interested in.

0,Point 1:  A lot of people want to live in London.  More in point of fact than there&#x27;s really room for.<p>Point 2:  We as a society really dislike the idea of telling people where they can and cannot live.  &quot;Your papers please&quot; is a punchline not a blueprint.<p>Point 3:  Britain in specific is very leary about development.  Not without reason but even though it would be absurdly profitable to build a fuckton of cheap efficient high rise apartments it is and will remain illegal.  (Which is fine; build the apartments and then you have traffic issues etc.  My point is that you can&#x27;t do this not that you should.)<p>Combine these three points and you&#x27;ll get high rents and frustrated people.  But unless you have a suggestion on how to change one of those points it&#x27;s not going to change is it?  (Well I guess you could say the high cost of housing is changing point 1 by making London less desirable but clearly it&#x27;s not happening quickly.)<p>Seriously though it feels like the article is missing a conclusion.  &quot;Here&#x27;s a thing that sucks but let&#x27;s not think about why it exists or how it might be fixed.&quot;<p>(But maybe I&#x27;m just being grumpy I dunno.)

So assuming there is a large supply of skilled data scientists in India and Ukraine but not the demand then they can&#x27;t charge higher wages.<p>Furthermore if these barriers could be broken down and there was no longer an advantage to being local then we would expect the price of Western and other workers to equalize but the final wage would be somewhere in between the current Indian wage and the current Western wage.

0,I see a couple of people pointing out opportunities for analytics which I suppose is a bit interesting but I find the whole thing pretty distasteful.<p>Who would spend time building such an app? It&#x27;s literally useless. During a standup you literally go around and ask everyone what they did and they reply. That&#x27;s it and that&#x27;s all. One of the nice things about it is how it doesn&#x27;t require anything else especially this kind of tool.
0,&gt; Promoting address reuse isn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>Depends on the application and the purpose of the blockchain but the paper isn&#x27;t explicitly premoting address reuse.<p>&gt; The assumption that an attacker will tell you he is attacking isn&#x27;t a very strong one.<p>Users don&#x27;t consider blocks committed until they&#x27;ve seen +2&#x2F;3 of commit signatures so a fork implies that the victim has evidence of double-signing.<p>&gt; This security assumption means means that no one can safely join the network and perform an initial sync.<p>Not sure what you mean -- Maybe an analogy will clarify.  Is this a problem that isn&#x27;t present in Bitcoin?  How can a brand new Bitcoin user securely join the network for the first time?<p>We don&#x27;t prevent long-range attacks.  We assume that they will happen and the clients should be coded accordingly.  For example if my phone wallet hasn&#x27;t synced with the network in a while (longer than the unbonding period) then it should warn me the next time I connect and perhaps ask me to validate a fingerprint of the blockchain via outside channels.<p>I&#x27;m aware of how checkpoints prevent reorgs in other protocols like PeerCoin.  That&#x27;s not how Tendermint works.<p>&gt; So how do the validators solve the Byzantine Generals Problem?<p>Perhaps a prerequisite to understanding the Tendermint paper is to first understand the DLS algorithm.  It works in a similar but different way.  In short it&#x27;s a round-based 2-phase locking system (prevotes and precommits) with a 3rd phase of signing on top to commit.  Without the round-based 2-phase locking system the protocol would have the problem that you mentioned.  But assuming that there are less than 1&#x2F;3 of byzantine voting power the validators <i>will</i> come to consensus before they start committing.<p>&gt; stakegrinding attack with an incredibly small validator&#x2F;voter %<p>Stakegrinding is less of an issue in Tendermint because of the deterministic round-robin algo for choosing the proposer and the fact that the remaining validators need to commit.  There are subtle attacks involving the timing-out of validators but there are also workarounds.  These attacks are probably not what you have in mind when you mention stakegrinding.<p>TLDR: Check out the DLR algorithm first &quot;Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony (1988)&quot; and then lets keep the discussion.  Also check out forum.tendermint.com for some other Q&amp;As.

0,&gt; Not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say here? Its a cartoon about a stick figure who can&#x27;t code. Funniest part was &quot;it&#x27;s like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at ikea and made random edits until it compiled without errors&quot; lol<p>I&#x27;m just poking a little fun at your earlier reductionism. You&#x27;re right it&#x27;s just a stick figure. A real human has not been hurt.<p>My main issue with the comic is that it&#x27;s not particularly funny. To me. The zingers don&#x27;t really zing. It&#x27;s just someone whaling on someone else for three panels. And since I&#x27;m not catching onto the humor all I&#x27;m left with is the weird feeling that the comic is condoning that kind of behavior.

0,Apple seems to rely on long term user training sometimes. I knew that was a send button because I have used previous versions of iOS it&#x27;s never even occurred to me that it doesn&#x27;t look like a button at all. Similarly I was late to the iOS party I joined around iOS4-ish and there were features I discovered completely on accident. Like double clicking the home button on the lock screen to bring up audio controls. Great feature but I had no idea it was there. People joining in the next few years probably won&#x27;t know to swipe from the top or bottom until they do it by accident.

0,I&#x27;m calling nerd.<p>A lot of us have monomaniacal interests.  A programmer who works all day programming and spends his free time programming other things and writing blogs about programming and posting on forums about programming is going to meet a lot of programmers.  Cows in a cow pasture are going to spend a lot of time with other cows.<p>If you ratchet down your monomania just a little it&#x27;s very easy to meet non-programmers.  Join a Latin reading group and you meet a lot of classicists.  Join a beekeeping meet-up and you meet a lot of beekeepers.  Join a weekly board game group and you meet lots of gamers.<p>I&#x27;m willing to believe programmers are prone to monomania.

Granted it&#x27;s debatable how much worse but Bing &#x2F; Duck Duck go are viewed as competitive search engines not <i>better</i> search engines.  Plenty of people are doing regular head to head comparisons with people using different search engines for the same query if they can&#x27;t find it on one they use the other.  After a while the &#x27;better&#x27; engine generally becomes their dealt.<p>Windows on the other hand has a lot of inertia due to third part integration.  For example there is a much smaller selection of games on OS X than windows which creates a feedback loop.  There is no way OS X could hit 50% market share in 3 years let alone a brand new OS starting from scratch but search has seen massive swings in market share fairly recently.<p>PS: The g! feature is also great for fine tuning their search engine.

0,No they absolutely won&#x27;t. Look for Universities not to fix themselves but to be largely side-stepped by alternative education techniques until such time as the Universities are simply unable to ignore the fact that they are no longer the only source of &quot;higher education&quot;.<p>It&#x27;ll probably be a twenty-year process but as long as the Universities prefer to withdraw on their several hundred years of respect until that account is absolutely drained rather than become cheaper or better for the masses no other outcome is possible. And at the moment I see no reason to believe the Universities will budge until they&#x27;ve run those accounts absolutely dry. The administrators will happily ride this ride into the ground... what else is in it for them?<p>(Look for ever more desperate appeals to the aforementioned multi-century &quot;respect&quot; account as they go down. Personally I&#x27;m more interested in the first derivative and it is clearly negative. Spend spend spend it&#x27;s all they seem to know how to do for every account they can get their hands on.)

2,Ask HN: Any good investments for those saving a substantial portion of income?
0,I think that we get a really skewed view of things because we&#x27;re on Hacker News a site that focuses much more on startups. If we were on Factory Manager News or Corporate Retail News there would be much much less talk about firing. The practices of these startups are very different from established companies. I can&#x27;t imagine IBM Intel or Microsoft engaging in this sort of behavior for better (refraining from firing people for stupid immature reasons) or for worse (not being able to get rid of shitty people).<p>Startups are the Wild West when it comes to employment. Their nature means that many of the people running the show have never actually hired and managed employees before and they have no good role models for doing so. Sometimes it works out well and sometimes it works out atrociously.

0,Your analogy to estimating 23 across is pretty amusing.  I like it a bit more than the claim that software estimates are like asking how long it will take to detect dark matter (another one I&#x27;ve heard) because honestly I really shouldn&#x27;t try to equate my work with something on that scale.  That said I actually think your analogy is if anything a bit too optimistic about estimates.  In some ways I&#x27;d stretch it to &quot;you&#x27;re good at puzzles.  how long will it take to solve next week&#x27;s puzzle&quot;.  You know that puzzles are usually crosswords sudokus word scrambles or chess problems and you can usually get them even the hard ones.  There&#x27;s variance and sometimes you do get stumped so it&#x27;s a bit stressful but at least you have some kind of prior history as a guide.  But surprisingly often it turns out to be something like encountering a rubik&#x27;s cube for the first time.   How long does it take to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube?  Well once you know how to solve one it takes less than 5 minutes.  How long does it take to figure out how to solve one when you&#x27;ve never encountered it?  Well for some never.  For others a month?  For a few people a day?<p>But the answer is it will take me anywhere from 30 minutes to a month to tell you how long it will take me to solve this problem (over 1 month I give up).  Then my answer will be: 5 minutes.

0,DNT is not a technology that will automatically restrict people from tracking you like adBlock for instance. The idea is that good citizens will honor your choice of not be tracked.<p>It needs buy in from both users advertisers and publishers. If you make it so that you only get approval from users advertisers and publishers will ignore it and the whole thing collapses. They already have very little incentive to honor it.<p>We could have seen laws in the future requiring business to honor it. But this move by Microsoft gave publishers&#x2F;advertisers all the weapons they would need to fight those bills. It no longer express the choice of the users and that was the key of DNT.<p>Microsoft move completely removed any possibility that publishers or advertisers could support it basically killing the proposal. It is their fault. Do not expect to see anyone honoring it anytime soon.

0,The problem with Simcity is that &#x27;traffic&#x27; would basically take absolutely any turn that would get them to where they wanted to go. This meant that if you had a gridded layout of large wide avenues four-lane primary streets and two-lane side streets your traffic will gladly back up for miles outside of town because everyone entering your city is trying to take a two-lane side street to get to their destination <i>even if it&#x27;s on an avenue</i> just because turning onto that side street is the first available option.<p>They later updated the algorithm apparently to do path cost routing making it far more preferable to take avenues over dirt roads but until then the only way your city could work at all was to create it entirely out of cul-de-sacs.<p>There was also an issue with the train service where when a commuter train came to an intersection it would <i>randomly</i> choose which direction to take. This meant that if you had a grid of avenues some of your sims would be waiting for <i>hours</i> for a train because the train is bouncing randomly around your downtown instead of dropping anyone off.<p>Moving to a system where there were literally no intersections at all for your trains was the only way to make your mass transit system a benefit and not a liability.

0,Well first it depends on the valuation but that goes for any equity financing round. But also it depends on the type of investor you are taking on and their expectations for returns to fit in their profile.<p>Private investors tend to invest in higher risk&#x2F;reward equities meaning you need to achieve higher growth rates to satisfy them. I am guessing many of the companies raising massive private rounds now need to still grow significantly before a liquidity event could justify the investor&#x27;s investment (once you go public the pressure isn&#x27;t as high to achieve 2-3x growth year over year). Publicly traded technology stocks are expected to grow at most 20-30%&#x2F;year without further diluting the equity pool. Every new private financing round makes the pool a little smaller meaning you still need to grow even faster to achieve the returns required by your investors.<p>In addition once you IPO you have access to many other forms of financing that are significantly cheaper than selling equity.

0,I&#x27;m a major supporter of open allocation (I coined the term) as used by Valve and Github but I&#x27;m skeptical of &quot;flat&quot; organizations. It&#x27;s not that I dislike the idea. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really possible.<p>One of the reasons (at least in theory) why legible middle management is a good thing is that they don&#x27;t have to compete with the managed for visibility and work. When you have emergent pseudo-managers (or managerial favorites) who are still technically the same rank but far more influential they use their influence in competition with the other workers and do a lot of damage: it&#x27;s not a fair competition because they take the sexy work and delegate the crap. Most Valley startups tell every engineer that he&#x27;s reporting to the CTO... but then they get there and there are 57 people nominally reporting to that CTO which means that they <i>actually</i> report to the people who have the CTO&#x27;s ear (and that changes over time).<p>I like <i>the idea</i> of a flat organization but I think what you <i>actually</i> need is constitutional management. You need a strong set of principles (&quot;employees are trusted to allocate their time to anything that provides business value&quot; i.e. open allocation) and then you need <i>official</i> and legible managers who are accountable for enforcing them. It&#x27;s better to know who is in power so you can hold them accountable and remove them from power if they fail than have a &quot;flat organization&quot; where power disparities still exist but are subtle. You need checks and balances you need laws and you need cops but the cops shouldn&#x27;t be making laws on a whim.<p>In other words the optimal point is somewhere between the demarchy of the &quot;flat organization&quot; and the executive dictatorship of the traditional corporation.<p>Flat organizations in general make it harder to define accountability. Look at the case of Ellen Pao for example. Venture capital partnerships are flatter than traditional corporate hierarchies and rarely have HR departments with any power over the partner level but are still afflicted by infighting and retaliation. Pao&#x27;s case is one where (a) she was clearly wronged but (b) her <i>legal</i> case appears pretty weak (or at least lives in undefined territory). It&#x27;s obvious that a creepy ex-boyfriend (or more accurately ex-few-night-stand) took vindictive and inappropriate steps to ruin the internal reputation of a talented female venture capitalist and that this prevented her from having a successful career at KP. It&#x27;s unclear whether the firm or its upper management is legally responsible. <i>He</i> was engaging in retaliation but upper management wasn&#x27;t; they were denying her promotion based on (faulty maliciously provided) information about her performance not her gender. It&#x27;s unclear <i>who</i> is responsible; clearly the man in question (since then fired) is but he probably doesn&#x27;t have the money to make her whole. So should Kleiner <i>itself</i> be held responsible? That&#x27;s really hard to answer. That&#x27;s a problem with flat organizations in general; they still have politics and they still have good people ending up with bad reputations and vice versa but the lines responsibility and accountability are less clearly drawn.

0,<i>&quot;because there&#x27;s no generally agreed upon positive account for how cognition works AGI is impossible in the near term.&quot;</i><p>Mis-characterization as it&#x27;s completely plausible that we can get to AGI without emulating cognition at all. So that is explicitly not the point I am making and no one is even stating as much.<p>You said it yourself though:<p><i>but it&#x27;s piecemeal and has not been adequately integrated</i><p>Integration is the foundation of GENERAL intelligence and is exactly what I am saying. How learning across domains works is a black box - like total black box right now - which means we can&#x27;t build a roadmap to it without probing the edges more.<p><i>Excellent accounts of how intelligence work can be contained in the minds of a few researchers who aren&#x27;t going to the trouble of publishing them and proving them to others. Instead they&#x27;re just hard at work on the highest payoff activity: designing software that realizes and proves their vision&#x2F;idea.</i><p>Hooray a hypothesis! Is there anything that you can point to that would support the idea of lone wolf AGI developers? In my study there isn&#x27;t due primarily to computational and mathematical requirements that take a community to support. Even in such a case there is basically nothing we can do about it because it&#x27;s unknowable - like lone wolf terrorists. So practically it&#x27;s not worth discussing. Note also that this isn&#x27;t even what Bostrom et. al are discussing.

Buzzfeed is now famously refusing to host ads. Instead they sustain themselves by publishing content that subtly supports the agenda of any company with deep enough pockets to pay for it. A viewer&#x27;s ability to distinguish between native ads and regular articles is small and quickly vanishing. If separate ads stop reaching people the path to monetization remaining is to change your content to reflect someone else&#x27;s agenda.<p>I keep AdBlock off by default because I prefer a world where creators can make a meaningful articles and a useful apps without caring about who they are supporting and can as the price tag separately attach an ad.<p>I do see it as a moral issue. There are good people making content that&#x27;s being sustained by ads. I am never going to remember to give them my modicum of support if I don&#x27;t consider them innocent until proven guilty. It&#x27;s worth the small annoyance. It&#x27;s worth the 2 seconds it takes to turn it on for the problematic pages. Hell you can even map it to a shortcut[1]. It sucks but the alternative is positively bleak.<p>.<p>TL;DR: The bathroom may be dirty but at least no one&#x27;s taking a shit in my kitchen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adblockplus.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;faq_customization#shortcuts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adblockplus.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;faq_customization#shortcuts</a>

(Have a large chunk of random data. The hash is a couple iterations of a standard password hash but each time used as an index into the random data. You want multiple iterations as otherwise someone walking off with a relatively small section of the data can still crack many passwords.)<p>If you&#x27;re preventing brute-force there are better methods. For example having the client submit a proof-of-work. (As a bonus to this you can adjust the proof of work if you&#x27;re under (D)DOS.)

I don&#x27;t understand how you think based just on what I wrote that I have any special feelings in any directions about Stallman? In fact I barely read any articles from Stallman nor know much about him. Let alone I&#x27;d let some general opinion about him color <i>my</i> opinion on this article. I can assure you what I wrote above was based solely on this article and as objectively as possible. And basically all I said was &quot;true facts but not sure I agree everybody should just ditch FB based on this&quot;.<p>Oh yeah I&#x27;m not even American but European. Although again: I do not think that matters much? Why do you think it does (honest question - you seem to have a strong idea that somehow the US is against him and others aren&#x27;t. May I ask why?)

So the building I work in has an unarmed part time security guard but the company has plenty of money whereas the office down the road without any money might get 24x7 M1A1 tank patrol because they qualify for free military defense services due to poverty.  Imagine how many accountants and social workers we could employ if we treated all areas of society this way.<p>Do these people &quot;deserve&quot; free EPA service to protect their river or do they only &quot;deserve&quot; it if poor people swim there often enough?  We could spend millions and employ dozens.<p>The TLDR of the whole discussion is we&#x27;ve designed fabulously complicated and baroque systems to save pennies while being pound foolish.

1,Ask HN: Who is Hiring? (July 2011)
0,* &quot;Seattle is incredibly friendly and polite&quot;<p>My ten-year residence in Seattle (U District Lake City and Burien&#x2F;Tukwila) led me to use terms like &quot;passive-aggressive&quot; &quot;frigid&quot; and &quot;unaware&quot;.<p>Seattle drivers are particularly terrible -- they&#x27;ll force a line of 20 cars to stop just so they can &quot;politely&quot; let someone in who would have been able to turn just fine ten seconds later when all the cars had passed; they&#x27;re perfectly willing to inconvenience multiple other people in order to be superficially polite to one.  If there&#x27;s a space in front of them they&#x27;ll speed up getting right on the bumper of the car in front of them -- even if there&#x27;s plenty of room to pass -- and then follow closely as if they just can&#x27;t stand being more than a few yards behind the next car.  (This particular passive-aggressive maneuver is so distinctive that I once identified a vehicle on the interstate in Kansas as &quot;drives like they&#x27;re from Seattle&quot; from a distance confirming from the licence plate when I got closer.)<p>I also noticed that everyone in Seattle was polite to my face but the majority of long-term friends I made while in Seattle were from other places.  The people who turned out to be fake friends were mostly the natives.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Seattle entirely sucks.  It was a neat place to live and there are a lot of good people there.  But I find it interesting how differently we perceive the same social scene and how that contributes to my being much happier far away from there.

0,First off this seems like unordered notes and I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what the actual requirements were because it was saying things it needed and then talking about solutions that didn&#x27;t have those features.<p>Anyway the main goal seems to be even density of chosen numbers while also not skipping floats.  In other words the probability of any specific float being chosen is proportional to its width.<p>This is easy to do and needs no rounding.  At least for [01)<p>Observe that floats [.51) are half the probability space.  Use one random bit to choose between them and smaller values.<p>Then floats [.255) are half the space.  Use another random bit.<p>Once you&#x27;ve chosen the exponent fill in the mantissa with 52 random bits.  All floats in the range are the same distance apart so random bits work fine.<p><pre><code>  mantissa := random(2^52)  exponent := -1  while random(2) == 1:    exponent -= 1  return (1 + mantissa&#x2F;2^52) * 2^exponent</code></pre>If you <i>really</i> want [01] then you must first define how wide of a range of real numbers you want to assign to &quot;1&quot;.  Rounding toward zero makes more sense.  Alternatively note how nonzero double precision floats go down below 2^-1000.  You will never ever actually generate a zero no matter what you do.  Why should &quot;1&quot; be more likely than &quot;0&quot;?<p>But if you insist on rounding to nearest then you can put in a special clause where a mantissa of 0 has a 50% chance of being treated as 2^52.

0,Public bare getters&#x2F;setters! Hisss!!!!!<p>To elaborate this is one of the most common annoyances I have with Java ecosystems. In an attempt to make everything Objectionable (ho-ho!) coders write classes with their internal data structure marked as private but then make getters and setters (which do nothing other than set or retrieve the value) which are public.<p>The result is that their internal data structure is actually public (since its advertised through the getters&#x2F;setters) but with the added bonus of extra function calls and member offset resolutions (i.e. it makes execution slower while single-handedly destroying the main benefit that OOP offers—backwards compatibility through isolation of the internal data structure).<p>While it doesn&#x27;t surprise me to see new-to-OOP coders making this kind of mistake I find it troubling that many FAQs&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;classes actually advocate for these patterns.<p>On the bright side the web page looks nice :)

0,Over building renewables and transport capacity would probably be worse than the status quo in terms of cost and carbon generation.  Peak power which is dictated by people&#x27;s general schedule dictates both the generation and capacity requirements.  It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to over build renewables when everyone is using power after the sun went down or when you can&#x27;t control when the wind blows. In ERCOT (Texas) the price of electricity overnight (when the wind is blowing) often goes negative meaning that the power producer pays you to use electricity.<p>This is why the next generation of battery technology is going to be so groundbreaking.  It will allow batteries to become more economical feasible both on a small and large scale.  It simply cause renewables to become more societally efficient.

If you don&#x27;t believe it you can download the tests and run them yourself. Overall it&#x27;s a very good read especially since he also tries to explain why they fail.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;281-call-me-maybe-carly-rae-jepsen-and-the-perils-of-network-partitions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;281-call-me-maybe-carly-rae-jepsen-a...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;tags&#x2F;jepsen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;tags&#x2F;jepsen</a>

0,You&#x27;re completely ignoring equity.<p>Mortgage payments are based on the loan amount not the value of the property. Excluding transactions costs if you buy a $X house and have $Y month payments then the property value doubles to $2X you can sell and still buy another house that costs $2X add $X to the down payment and still have a $Y&#x2F;month mortgage.<p>So if you own a home not only do you have mobility but if you move to another house of lesser value you can extract equity without increasing monthly costs.<p>Now Prop 13 is what restricts mobility for homeowners because property tax can be 10x on a new purchase if you&#x27;ve been in the old house long enough. Rent control and Prop 13 both need to go.

Here in Bay Area more people say &quot;Why not? That sounds fun.&quot; and they either help you build it or fund it. Yeah a lot of times the things built here are crazy and make no sense... but sometimes sometimes you end up with a Google.<p>Of course I could be wrong since places like Atlanta have institutions like Georgia Tech. Maybe things have changed (or will change) like in New York? ...but I haven&#x27;t seen strong evidence of that yet.

0,I dont think that is the case. US government has abdicated its primary duties for protecting interests of military-industry complex.<p>What evidence did US provide before attacking Afghanistan? Surely 9&#x2F;11 was an aggression but US had no evidence to link it with the state of Afghanistan. After American ass got whooped in Afgan they have returned claiming Taliban are no more as bad as they use to be.<p>What evidence does US have to carry out random Drone strikes in Pakistan killing random people ?<p>And let me not even start with Iraq which did absolutely nothing to offend US but instead was destroyed in the name of WMD that did not exist.<p>But when it comes to Iran where US interest might have legitimate threat where Chinese expansion in South China sea and many other places where US could have used its military muscle the government acts as if they are China&#x27;s bitch.<p>The real problem I think is that US government has lost the sight of legitimate national security over spending taxpayers money making their friends rich.

0,I have to agree with you on context <i>especially</i> for technical and energy-issues stories.  And yes journalists are exceptionally lacking and poor in this regard.<p>That said there are tools out there which help.  There&#x27;s an immense wealth of information available online -- we can look up the population of Beijing (20 million via Wikipedia) the International Energy Agency and other sources have various energy statistics.<p>A favorite tool of mine is gnu &#x27;units&#x27; a commandline calculator that many people associate with simple transformations from feet to meters.  But that misses out on its key capabilities -- it&#x27;s really an advanced units-aware calculator with a large number of built-in values.  I just found earlier today that this includes paper sizes:<p><pre><code>    $ units &#x27;A4paper&#x27;            Definition: 210 mm 297 mm = 0.06237 m^2</code></pre>It&#x27;s also extensible -- I&#x27;ve added &#x27;hiroshima&#x27; as an energy unit.  Given the context of the current discussion that in tons of coal equivalent:<p><pre><code>    $ units &#x27;1 hiroshima&#x27; &#x27;toncoal&#x27;    	* 1942.6672    	&#x2F; 0.0005147562</code></pre>For more discussion features and use:<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1x9u0f/gnu_units_utility_and_energy_resource_calculations/" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1x9u0f&#x2F;gnu_uni...</a><p>Getting back to your question how does one 845 MW plan compare with Beijing&#x27;s energy usage?<p><pre><code>    You have: 845MW &#x2F; 20 million    You want: watt            * 42.25            &#x2F; 0.023668639</code></pre>... I <i>presume</i> China&#x27;s power supply exceeds 42 watts per capita (though I happen to know from context that third-world nations are at roughly this level).  Wikipedia again tells us that the national average is 458 watts&#x2F;person which probably includes less-developed rural areas.  So it&#x27;s likely that the shuttered power plant is at best 1&#x2F;10 Beijing&#x27;s power supply quite possibly less than that.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_electrici...</a><p>That said yes poor and sloppy contextualization on the part of Bloomberg and Feifei Shen.

In our house we don&#x27;t have the TV area because computers have replaced the TV but this is considered very poor by some people who think watching on anything smaller than 50&quot; is like washing dishes in a filthy stream.

For every thing that doesn&#x27;t work there are thousands of cases where it does.<p>And let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. It&#x27;s all very difficult what our public servants do.

0,The maps lack normalization by population density. But even that might be misleading for example industrial areas having low population densities but nonetheless a lot of people in the area during working hours. And while population density might be relevant for some crimes it might be irrelevant for others. Where not to park your car is probably better normalized by the number of parking spaces or even the number of cars present. So don&#x27;t try to read to much out of maps or charts not specifically crafted to answer the question you are interested in.

0,Except that poor people pay the most money for value transfer even using Hawala just like paying the most for electricity or water or healthcare. When you can&#x27;t make large infrastructure investments like most OECD countries can ordinary utilities become massively expensive. And even clever systems like Hawala command a market price just like any other service. In a world without great alternatives that price is high.<p>Read some reports and you&#x27;ll find the average cost of remittance for poorer countries averages around 10% an absurd borderline criminal rate.<p>You&#x27;ll simultaneously find inflation rates of 10-30% not being uncommon.<p>The ability then to access international derivative markets i.e. the option to easily buy and hold dollars using bitcoin providing relief from crazy inflation and the ability to transfer it to others at the cost of moving 500 bytes of data is hugely interesting.<p>Services like Bitpesa (cheaper remittance) or Bitreserve (hold money in different currencies using bitcoin) are the first such steps. In a few years I expect these things to massively undercut remittance costs and provide interesting relief from inflation. Some of the things the early Paypal founders were interested in including Peter Thiel who spoke on the topic often in the early days.

She was telling me the other day about how the students are all writing apps for their phones nowadays.  I laughed and said &quot;Haha no way.  5th graders??&quot;  She replied &quot;Yeah one girl has been working on an app for organizing health information.  She wants to go into the medical field and cure cancer when she&#x27;s older.  Her app lets you input names body weight height and other health information&quot;.  My jaw dropped.  She went on &quot;It&#x27;s strange; when we were younger you were the only one I knew doing this weird stuff.  Now they all are.&quot;<p>Granted she&#x27;s teaching a gifted class at a top ranked (public) elementary school but still -- that many fifth graders know how to program for iOS or Android?  I was surprised.<p>So I think your point is spot on. The next generation is going to &quot;grow up to live in a world where we would have free access to educational materials and other wonderful information over the internet.&quot;  The &quot;could&quot; will turn into a &quot;can&quot;.

0,Very nice! Since writing a thesis is a very special task I think it&#x27;d be great to have such a app be geared towards that purpose. In addition to the features I now know I needed I feel like I&#x27;ve gathered quite some experience on how to achieve control reproducibility and flexibility using AsciiDoc but I didn&#x27;t have the chance to get it out of my head and written down :-) There are a few pitfalls with the asciidoc and dblatex chain which you only learn to navigate when you&#x27;re in the middle of writing the thesis (floating images word count bibliography organization etc.). The framework&#x2F;workflow I&#x27;ve set up considers most of them already and has been a huge timesaver and ease of mind for me. You can see some of the underlying ideas went into the Makefile I shared and you could recycle&#x2F;use them to get a head start on your thesis&#x2F;project. I&#x27;d definitely be happy to collaborate with you and share all my (MIT-licensed) experience :-) Feel free to shoot me an e-mail I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll find me through a quick google inquiry [1] ;-)<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmgtfy.com&#x2F;?q=lbnl+huck" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmgtfy.com&#x2F;?q=lbnl+huck</a>

0,I really doubt that anyone&#x27;s hands are actually tied. He could say whatever he wants like how it&#x27;s totally unacceptable and anyone acting like that should be dismissed. He could easily say it&#x27;s in the company&#x27;s interest because it shows Google stands up for women which is good for Google&#x27;s image and talent recruiting.<p>That&#x27;s why when people pull out &quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot; I think they&#x27;re quite exaggerating on what that entails. I&#x27;d be surprised if any laws or penalties apply to normal operating judgements. It&#x27;s gotta be more for scenarios like a company selling a subsidiary at below-market price or obviously negative-financial stuff like that.

It&#x27;s routine to pay several dollars per minute for voice and per megabyte for data. If the data roaming is really no-strings attached this is a must-buy for me (if it ever becomes available in the UK).

Nor does the HD 5300 beat the HD 6000. Let alone if you max out both it&#x27;ll be 1.3gh vs 2.2gh for the MB and Air respectively.<p>Sure the MB starts with more mem&#x2F;ssd. But you can configure the air to have just as much without spending more.<p>With the air 13&#x27; having an extra inch 3 hours more battery more ports better performance the only thing the MB has going for it is resolution.

Great work is expensive because it takes a lot of experience to do and there are a lot of opportunities for those with a lot of experience. But if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice the &quot;great work&quot; part there are plenty of people out there with less experience doing (potentially) less great work for less cost. Everybody would like above market work for below market cost but it doesn&#x27;t tend to work that way.

However there&#x27;s a bug with full screen on OSX that is a deal-breaker and keeps sending me back to Sublime: if you swipe between full-screen instances of Atom sometimes modals end up in the wrong place but you can&#x27;t get to that instance. So you have to hard-kill and imagine if that modal is a Save As. (the other day it did something differently strange and annoying: Have 2 projects A and B open. Swiping between full screens it only showed A.. only way to get B was to select from Window menu and this behavior kept persisting whenever I&#x27;d swipe away)

So in the case of deploying images then yes: you get repeatable copies of the image. <i>Provided you know where the image came from</i>. Images themselves aren&#x27;t usually stored in a version control or configuration management system. It may not be obvious where the image came from. And if an image is made up of numerous &quot;parts&quot; (ie all the installed software) you need to know what those parts are. If an SSL vulnerability is announced what is the process for guaranteeing that you&#x27;ve updated all the master copies and re-imaged as necessary?

0,I was being <i>very</i> generous (good microscope high-end Oki heat gun and soldering iron which professionals would use).<p>Chinese imports are at the $100 range for the gun and iron.  Microscope probably not unless you can get by with a USB microscope of some form.  Although you can get by with the same stuff that jewelers use (glasses loupes etc.)<p>And I&#x27;m sorry but good tools for doing anything cost actual money.  Anvils sledgehammers etc. all cost near $50+ or so.<p>However you are <i>significantly</i> underestimating the cost to hack on an Apple II.  First the Apple II was damn expensive--it was almost the price of a new <i>CAR</i>.  Chips were way more expensive and you needed a lot more of them.  Edge connector cards and edge connectors were very expensive.<p>There was a reason why so many people loved the TRS-80 Color Computer for robotics and control applications for many years.  It had analog ports you could get at with inexpensive connectors and the connector on the side had almost every digital signal and wasn&#x27;t ferociously expensive (although it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  IIRC prototyping cards for it were in the $70 range in 1981).<p>Things are <i>WAY</i> better now for the hobbyist even with surface mount technology.

Not equipment but instead your home working. Of course it includes equipment but it’s installed it’s monitored it’s repaired it’s kept working at all times.&#x27;&quot;<p>Home-automation or IoT will be placing technology into one of the most personal spaces of people&#x27;s lives their home. But it isn&#x27;t going to take-off until its customer experience moves beyond that which only the DIY or Makers can enjoy. This sort of accreted services of IoT is what people need at least at first in order to build the confidence needed for this to happen.<p>Any architect over 70 will tell you this is like the 3rd time home-automation has tried to get air under its wings. For many reasons but mainly a mix of fractionalization and poor UX it never grew to the point where it could become affordable. I remember back in the early-2000&#x27;s the SmartWeb Fridges and stoves that never made it because of cost and other issues. Now mix-in security issues along with the perennial fractionalization and poor UX and this &quot;future&quot; could end-up like GoogleGlass.<p>It&#x27;s going to be fascinating to see how all of this works out.

0,Erm so you could possibly do some stuff like this (probably not for Js). It&#x27;s called profile guided optimisation - you compile run take measurements and the compiler uses those measurements to pick the right optimisations to use.<p>I don&#x27;t know how desirable it would be - you&#x27;d be shifting the burden from the compiler to the network basically.<p>In particular you&#x27;d still have to compile it which means that all you&#x27;re gaining is the time before JIT decides that the code&#x27;s super hot.<p>A nicer approach might be like Oracle hints - you have a small comment you place above a function that tells the JIT how you want it compiled. You test your software using an instrumented browser and that adds the comments between you finishing and it running.<p>It kinda ups the complexity by loads though - and I bet the benefits would be relatively small. Stuff like minifying and compressed assets has really tangible benefits but here you have something that can easily be done wrong and really only improves the execution of a very small overall percentage of functions.

0,&gt; In this use case it&#x27;s not necessary to figure out how similar strings are because it&#x27;s completely irrelevant.<p>I don&#x27;t follow since that&#x27;s pretty much the definition of &quot;fuzzy search&quot;. Your algorithm considers the query to be similar to the searched text if the latter contains all the characters in query in the same order.<p>If the use case is just to allow users to type the first few letters of each word or something that algorithm works great so advising &quot;anyone&quot; to look elsewhere didn&#x27;t make sense.<p>If users expect to be able to make typos other than leaving out characters though it doesn&#x27;t work and that&#x27;s often what people think of when they see &quot;fuzzy search&quot;. I just wanted to point out that you could use Levenshtein + a BK-Tree or something and get those results if desired though yeah it&#x27;d definitely be more complicated but I doubt it&#x27;d be too slow.

There was only one recorded instance of double spend during the event which was intentional it and any descendant transactions would have been invalidated on the chain that did not win.<p>&gt; <i>Please explain why all of the above does not count as the network being &quot;shut down&quot; in any sense of the word.</i><p>Well &quot;shut down&quot; implies that nothing was operational the network was perfectly functional it just happened to have fragmented due to an oversight in the way the underlying database in 0.7 was configured (you could non deterministically run out of locks 0.8 didn&#x27;t have the same failure but wasn&#x27;t wide spread at the time). It might not have been safe to rely on untrusted transactions from outside sources during the event but anybody not doing this had zero risk whatsoever. The main losers in this event were the miners who threw away their block reward to speed up the resolution of the fork which were re compensated at a later time anyway.<p>&gt; <i>and also that any transactions that you did on the v0.8 block might need to be re-broadcast?</i><p>The client handles this automatically.

How can we expect employee of software development companies to understand software licensing copyright or that downloading stuff from the internet doesn&#x27;t automatically make it free-for-fall. On the other hand the software industry seems to be very aware of piracy that downloading stuff from the pirate bay is copyright infringement and that its not free just because its on the internet.<p>I am thus torn to the suggestion that this is a education problem.

0,You are making a very generic statement by saying &quot;developer state that they use Windows by choice&quot;. If you read the entire post he clearly says that he uses a dual environment of Windows&#x2F;Linux. He uses Visual Studio which is certainly one of the best IDEs and right now it only works on windows. So it is not like he is <i>only</i> using windows but he is using what works best for him. He also uses Vim as he clearly explained. Isn&#x27;t that the point for developers that they use the tools they are most comfortable with ?<p>I am not a Windows fanboy of course. I know Linux works really well for dev environments but if you prefer to use an IDE for development and not just a simple editor then I would argue that it is hard to beat Visual Studio. Sure you can program even in notepad. Again a choice. CLI is not always the answer. But then again Windows does have Powershell which has evolved well.<p>I will give you one example. If you are building ASP.NET MVC applications you really don&#x27;t have a better choice than Windows as you can integrate it really well within Visual Studio link with Git and pretty much do everything within VS including deployment. It just works. So there are uses cases like these where Windows makes sense.

It comes down to the following:<p>1) Embedded engineers are generally EE that have taken a course or two in software. Generally they are the &quot;best software guys&quot; from a group of middling to poor software guys. As such they reach for tools they are familiar with.<p>2) The product from embedded engineering is much different from web development. It might ship on a ROM for a part with &lt; 64kRAM. In circumstances such as this knowing your toolchain won&#x27;t add any complexities you don&#x27;t understand is very important and it doesn&#x27;t get much simpler than C. (Also most good embedded engineers use a restricted set of C that doesn&#x27;t include things like printf and malloc.)

0,&gt; It would be nice if there was a single easy to use site for mere mortals to enter bug reports (and others can comment on them vote on them process them etc)<p>Having worked for Mozilla for 5 years (Zack also is a former Mozillian) I actually don&#x27;t think that the root problem is the ease of use of the bug tracker.<p>Although bugzilla sucks we still managed to get a ton of bug reports from external folks.  But getting the bug report is only the first step.  Once you have it you need to at a minimum:<p>a) Figure out what part of the software is causing this bug.  For complex software like a browser figuring this out often requires deep technical knowledge of the system so is expensive time.<p>b) Figure out if the bug is already known.  This is again often nontrivial because one bug can manifest in ways that may look superficially dissimilar so requires an expensive person&#x27;s time.<p>c) Collect additional information from the reporter.  Most bug reports from muggles don&#x27;t have enough information to let you reproduce the issue without additional back-and-forth.  Since the bug reporter probably doesn&#x27;t live in bugzilla like Mozilla folks do they&#x27;re usually slow to respond if they respond at all.  I&#x27;ve had bugs I worked on a week only to have the original reporter disappear.  It&#x27;s understandable; all this communication takes a lot of work.<p>d) Reproduce the bug.  If you can&#x27;t reproduce go to (c).<p>e) If it&#x27;s a regression figure out when the bug was introduced.<p>f) Figure out if the bug is fixed in alpha&#x2F;beta&#x2F;nightly builds.<p>This is all before you actually try to write any code.<p>Every step here is more difficult and risky when the reporter isn&#x27;t a known entity so as a result if Zack or I file a bug against Firefox all things being equal we&#x27;re much more likely to be paid attention to than if a random person files a bug.  It&#x27;s just a basic cost-benefit analysis on the part of people who already have too much to do.<p>I&#x27;d say that 80% of bugs I fixed while I worked on Firefox were identified by Mozillians (either employees or regular contributors).  Which isn&#x27;t to say that the remaining 20% weren&#x27;t important -- they were which is why I fixed them!  But those 20% were a lot harder and riskier to fix and that&#x27;s not something I can imagine the best bug tracking software in the world ameliorating.

0,Lightweight goroutines depend on small stacks. General API design in Go depends on lightweight goroutines.<p>In particular Go style is to never write asynchronous APIs. Always write synchronous blocking code and when you need to work concurrently create a goroutine.<p>You cannot do this in C with pthread because OS threads are too heavyweight. So you end up in callback-based APIs that are harder to use and harder to debug (no useful stack traces).<p>This small feature has a surprisingly wide-ranging effect on the use of the language. It is a very big deal.<p>Go is very much about reinventing these low-level things.

Vendors like Oracle Microsoft IBM etc have been screwing them over for ages. Low cost data lakes are the new norm.<p>Of course I am talking about middle to enterprise companies. I am sure for individuals a typical LAMP setup is still going to be fine. But then again many of those are running their apps in the cloud and hence want a database that is resilient in the face of node outages. MySQL and PostgreSQL are both a PITA to get this right compared to almost every NoSQL database.

Those with means have different conspicuous consumption choices though and that&#x27;s awful difficult to ignore. A watch isn&#x27;t the same thing as food - not every billionaire would wear a watch necessarily but we must all eat. The usual dot com millionaire might buy a nice car like any other random person would but I really doubt that most lottery winners would buy something like a NetApp SAN to use at home for file storage (I would anyway and I&#x27;m really lame in most of the the consumer choices I make typically).

0,Wow. That was just a jokey comment about how angry I was about the Chinese govt.<p>As one of the billion people who live inside the Intranet &quot;protected&quot; by the GFW I guess I can say I&#x27;m quite aware about how and why this happened. Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.<p>For those who host things Chinese govt doesn&#x27;t like it usually just block the website altogether (Twitter FB and recently Google). But it had tried to block Github twice. Each time there is a <i>huge</i> response from the Chinese webizens (mainly programmers) calling to unblock it.<p>Another way to block certain content from a website is to filter by keyword (like Wikipedia). But GH is encrypted so that&#x27;s a no. The govt even tried to use some fake SSL certificates to MITM it. So some &quot;smart&quot; guys exploited this feature and created the repo greatfire&#x2F;wiki and things like this.<p>Then some evil guys from GFW thought of this way directing the attack at these user accounts to warn GH to remove these accounts.<p>What I don&#x27;t agree with you is the word &quot;reasonable&quot; (and the &quot;no&quot;). First it&#x27;s <i>never</i> &quot;reasonable&quot; to DDoS attack a website. Second if you can&#x27;t block the content you have a choice to block the website and take the bitter from every single webizen against you. Finally I believe it&#x27;s the website owner&#x27;s choice to choose who &#x2F; what they want to use their website. Since GH is a U.S. company (I guess) it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to listen to a sh*t from the Chinese govt.

0,&gt; Well we&#x27;re talking about a &#x27;nameless warrant&#x27; to only access something they could access at-will before so I don&#x27;t see that as a real problem.<p>No. A warrant means they can start accessing data. Install bugs tracking devices... the <i>whole works</i>. All fourth amendment protections are gone once a judge grants the Police a warrant.<p>The question is whether or not you want &quot;Metadata&quot; to be part of that pool or not. Personally speaking I don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; Maybe but things are much more complicated than public and not public.<p>Which is why discussion of this issue is important. The fact is you expect something from the Police that is different than the Status Quo for the past decades.<p>It frustrates me to no end when all the YCombinator posters around here complain and protest in obscure ways (ie: putting Snowden up as a statue in a park) and then they don&#x27;t really try and learn the intricacies of the law and try to find changes that everyone actually agrees upon.<p>The reason our political system is borked is because no one is actually discussing the law or how to change it. Our Congressmen get vague clues (ie: SOPA BAD!!) but they really are struggling to understand our opinion in general.

Nowhere else in the world can compete.<p>It&#x27;s not for lack of trying. Louisiana for example will pay 35% of a programmers salary indefinitely[1]; other states and cities have similar programs. That&#x27;s serious competition. But the talent&#x2F;money vortex of the bay area is not just winning it&#x27;s actually <i>getting stronger</i>.<p>The other areas with real companies like Austin Seattle and New York still feel like also-rans compared to SF and the valley. If you want to raise money it&#x27;s still the place to go.<p>It&#x27;s just incredible to think about. Is there any other field where there&#x27;s just one geographical place that&#x27;s just so far ahead of anywhere else?

0,Our app Pacifica (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkpacifica.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkpacifica.com</a>) is built with Cordova and the Ionic Framework. It&#x27;s far from a crappy experience. I think that too often people pick these frameworks and assume that it&#x27;s a substitute for good design. You still need to put in the effort.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that the bar is a bit lower to get an app finished and released with something like Ionic. So you might see more apps that aren&#x27;t quite up to par but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it isn&#x27;t possible to create something beautiful with them.

It would relieve an incredibly overloaded infrastructure. (If there was going to be nowhere to move those people that would be a different problem but that&#x27;s not the current problem. There are many places with enough water to drink.)<p>I mean this is just the &quot;planetary carrying capacity&quot; issue applied to a smaller area. The argument still holds so if you accept the idea that the planet has a certain carrying capacity for a certain level of lifestyle the idea that maybe California can not support necessarily arbitrarily large numbers of people in a given lifestyle is just the same idea. Which idea is going to win out if they conflict?

0,Oklahoma is a seismically active region that has <i>always</i> had a lot of earthquakes in the magnitude 5 range. USGS even has dedicated seismic hazard maps for Oklahoma. This has been going on long before anyone was fracking in Oklahoma.<p>Most Americans are unaware that Oklahoma is an active seismic zone and articles like this prey on that ignorance by implying that these earthquakes arrived with fracking. There is a lot of fracking in places do not naturally have a lot of earthquakes but the fact that they always pick Oklahoma suggests that they are trying to construct a false correlation.<p>A lot of fracking occurs in California too but most people understand that earthquakes in California are going to happen whether you frack or not. Same with Oklahoma.

0,I came here wondering the same thing. Based on the comments above and what I know of the two editors and the fact that there were some improvements to minihtml and suddenly today the sublime text changelog popped in HTML format I would guess that minihtml is a light html renderer that can be used by plugins inside of sublime text. Atom already has this ability by design so it can do things like draw a usage graph in a side panel while previously sublime text could only have text-based panels produced by plugins. If I am correct minihtml should allow plugins to display more complex user interfaces and data through the a minihtml pane.

The amount of time shifting through positions I don&#x27;t want &gt;&gt; than pursuing those that I do.<p>The great employers don&#x27;t require to much chest thumping and I&#x27;ve had some down right fun interviews.  I question the culture of a company that uses a CTF game as a metric to hire people.  People who play and succeed at CTFs tend to be hyper-competitive and thats not always a wonderful characteristic in a team member or company.<p>Thats fair after reading some of your comments above.  I believe you don&#x27;t intend this to be more work for people.  And I believe hiring on both sides of the equation is a non trivial problem.

0,I&#x27;m not a crypto expert but I understand the terms and arguments made in this article.<p>&quot;Wary&quot; is the key word. If I have a true physical RNG I can certainly make 2 DVDs full of identical random numbers. I can share one with you -- physically not using email or barcodes. We can then communicate in the open saying something like &quot;beginning at position x on the DVD here is my message&quot; and nobody can <i>read the part of the message that travels between the crypto functions</i><p>They can still read my keystrokes or gain entrance to where I work and video record me. They can gain useful information simply based on the pattern of you and I communicating. They even may be able to surreptitiously copy our OTP by using compromised software. But the OTP part is secure.<p>The real problem is that the entire OSI stack is a leaking piece of crap. It&#x27;s been broken at every level. So even if you have &quot;perfect&quot; crypto? It doesn&#x27;t matter so much.<p>ADD: Nothing&#x27;s stopping you from using a OTP on top of a normal set of crypto algorithms. I like the OTP idea -- I&#x27;m just not sure in the current environment you&#x27;re getting anything from it.

0,I&#x27;m currently homeschooled (senior year) and I can say it really depends on the area. In my area homeschoolers are almost all conservative Christians who are very isolated from every other demographic. There are enough of them to form large groups so they&#x27;re not being completely deprived of social life but they&#x27;re being deprived of exposure to people who aren&#x27;t like them. They learn other viewpoints as caricatures and chances are they&#x27;ll go off to Bible school and never truly be exposed to other viewpoints in their life.<p>Other areas aren&#x27;t so unfortunate - usually a closely knit group of religiously homeschooled teenagers will end up just like a normal high school class - rebelling against their parents and growing up to be normal people. Larger cities have strong non-religious homeschool communities and the kids there are probably growing up fine (though I don&#x27;t personally know anyone in one of those groups).<p>I do know some homeschoolers who really do just sit in their room all day and never meet with other people their age. I was one for a while. Usually in that case there&#x27;s more at fault than just being homeschooled like Asperger&#x27;s or depression that&#x27;s not properly dealt with.<p>I&#x27;ve probably digressed from your question a bit but it&#x27;s hard to keep myself from rambling when I&#x27;m almost always the only person in these discussions who has actually been a homeschooler. :P (Edit: After reading more of the thread it looks like I&#x27;m not alone here!)<p>Personally I hang out with my friends from when I went to public school. It would be dreadful if I only knew the other homeschoolers in my area.

0,Me neither at least not in the way the smartness of the TV was intended to be used. My recently bought LG 60LB870V the then-flagship of December 2014 running webOS 1.x.<p>It turned out to be a really incredibly slow OS with the TV occasionally crashing due to RAM shortage (having to reboot the TV). It&#x27;s unbearable slow when &quot;SIMPLINK&quot; is on ie forwarding remote control key presses like &quot;play&quot; over HDMI to my Kodi player even for stuff that I don&#x27;t think is forwarded (volume etc). It can without exaggeration take 10s from eg volum-up-press to volume increasing on the TV. Unbearable.<p>Fortunately the smartness also allows me to control it programmatically. I&#x27;ve written a small node.js&#x2F;javascript module here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;lgtv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;lgtv</a> so that I can control it over my local network.<p>I use it to have a webapp served by my media server to press the Totoro-button to switch to HDMI_1 volume = 10 Kodi start movie Totoro (my daughter loves it). Etc. To qoute Jim Carrey &quot;There&#x27;s no end to the possibilities!&quot; :)

0,It&#x27;s less about Linux for me than about the other things I want to boot (MS is unlikely to disable Linux bootloaders on certified Windows PCs for lots of reasons).<p>By way of example the company where I work today produces a hypervisor for x86. We&#x27;re nowhere near big enough to exert market pressure on someone the size of MS or the hardware manufacturers. When we recently added UEFI support to our product we looked at support for UEFI secure boot as well. Some systems made key management easy (obvious bios options etc.) but others made it impossible. Upon investigation this mostly appears to be more due to apathy on the hardware vendors part than any conspiracy theory but for an end user the distinction is unimportant. Today we can work-around this by using an MS-signed bootloader shim but this reduces the security of the end solution (any ms-signed shim will boot a third party owns the root keys). And as I mentioned in my comment above MS can change their policies at any time.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into an x86 system yet that doesn&#x27;t at least allow you to disable secure boot but the trend towards more locked-down hardware in general (esp. in mobile) worries me due to the potential for anti-competitive behavior towards both commercial and open-source software from third parties.

0,I&#x27;m from Australia (no tipping) and have been living in North America for 9 years (always tipping) so this issue is close to my heart.<p>I&#x27;ve come to see tipping as a form of slavery the only twist being it&#x27;s paid - albeit very lowly.<p>It&#x27;s a way for people with money to say &quot;Hey peasant: <i>If</i> you do what I want and <i>if</i> I&#x27;m happy about it and <i>if</i> I feel like it I <i>might</i> give you a little of <i>my</i> money. Or not&quot;.<p>Sort of like a work contract where the employer has ultimate power and absolutely no rules to govern if they even have to pay their employees at all. Of course there are labor laws against that sort of thing in developed countries so tipping is just a way to circumvent those labor laws.<p>It would be much better if those people were simply paid what they should be paid by their employer in the first place and the terms of that were bound by labor laws.<p>I personally feel dirty every time I tip - it almost feels like being at a strip bar or something similar.<p>(To be clear I always tip because the people in those jobs rely on it. It&#x27;s not their fault I don&#x27;t like the system.)

1,Facebook machine learning technology improves; Redditors alaramed.
0,While interesting for a subset of use cases the reality is that testing software in any new environment must occur before trusting it in production.<p>It would be foolish at this point to trust such upgrades to be &#x27;100% clean slate&#x27; (ie. equivalent to rebooting to the new kernel). Case in point: if boot-time initialization code has changed eventual reboot may fail.<p>An interesting question may be then which operations workflow allows for the proactive testing of all three cases: (1) live upgrade kernel&#x2F;restart services (2) live upgrade&#x2F;reboot&#x2F;restart services (3) traditional upgrade&#x2F;reboot&#x2F;restart services ?<p>For the increase in complexity this creates combined with the sole benefit apparently being nominal speed of upgrade&#x2F;reduced downtime on a per-node basis (in an era where most people running serious services have either outsourced kernel management or are running multi-node HA clustering anyway) this seems a fairly edge-case feature.

0,OP if you read this if you decide to get married you REALLY need to do it before your visa expires (by as much as possible).<p>If you do it after you&#x27;ll technically be in the country illegally and they will reject your marriage visa automatically (i.e. you&#x27;ll have to go home to apply for your marriage visa they won&#x27;t even accept your application while you&#x27;re still illegally in the US).<p>It may already be too late to do this without having to leave the country. A marriage visa can take anywhere between six months and a year and half unless you can get them to rush it though (which they&#x27;ve done before but normally at foreign embassies rather than at the NVC and without kids a dependant or either of you being US military it will be hard to get an expedited process).<p>PS - Maybe consult an immigration attorney in your case.<p>PPS - If your visa is expired try not to get &quot;caught&quot; with it expired. Sneak out of the country to avoid a ban rather than getting a ban and trying to fight it. It could save you a long fight and literally years banned from the US.

0,Well at the time the article was written cfront was still the C++ implementation so this was a really long time ago.  C++ was arguably as bad as the article said... then.<p>I&#x27;d say that C++ being fixed and becoming more popular took place in parallel.  As it got used more people saw more things that needed fixed and as more things got fixed it became more useful for more people.<p>Why did things get fixed nearly as fast as they got identified as problems?  Because there was an arms race between Borland and Microsoft to have the best C++ compiler primarily.  That competition did wonders for the language (neglecting the horror of Microsoft&#x27;s incompatible and ugly extensions...)

2,The Decline of Wikipedia: As More People Rely on It Fewer People Create It
0,SLT is an interesting technology since it falls in between discrete transistors and integrated circuits. IBM&#x27;s SLT hybrid modules were metal packages 12mm on a side. Inside a module they put a few separate semiconductor dies (transistors and diodes) and precision-trimmed thick-film resistors on a tiny circuit board. It&#x27;s like an integrated circuit on the outside but separate components on the inside.<p>For a while IBM built SMS cards that used SLT modules in place of the discrete resistors and diodes. They needed to keep the discrete germanium transistors though because the SLT modules were silicon-based. A picture of one of these SMS cards is here: <a href="http://righto.com/sms/DGW.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;righto.com&#x2F;sms&#x2F;DGW.html</a> The result is extremely space-inefficient but it was a cheaper way of building backwards-compatible cards.

It&#x27;s vulnerable to a dictionary or bruteforce attack the same way everything else is.<p>You _can_ increase the difficulty of bcrypt which essentially increases the iterations (as you mentioned). Most bcrypt libraries default this value but the programmer can override it. The downside is that this requires you to update all of your hashes which limits how often this is done.

0,It does say 98% of private key transfers are not between the SIM supplier (Gemalto) and the carrier. It explicitly says those could be hacked more easily but are out of their hands. I have little doubt that many governments already monitor thier own people&#x27;s phone use anyway making the issue of surveillance irrelevant.<p>A bit surprising they promote security by obscurity though:<p>&quot;Security is even higher for mobile operators who work with Gemalto to embed custom algorithms in their SIM cards. The variety and fragmentation of algorithmic technologies used by our customers increases the complexity and cost to deploy massive global surveillance systems.&quot;

0,I hated Microsoft for years for all the stupid garbage they pulled. Antitrust stuff terrible software mismanagement etc. Even after switching to using a Mac full time I still had to deal with awful Office documents with undocumented changes or &#x27;XML-based&#x27; documents with undefined data formats. Sending my resume to someone and finding out the entire thing had been reformatted into Courier New and lost all my indenting making me look like an idiot etc.<p>But lately things have changed. Apple is the new Google loved by the tech world. Google is the new Microsoft using their market power to do dumb stuff that no one really cares about and Microsoft is the new Apple the underdog who got left behind by changing technology and ego and is making a serious determined effort to become and stay relevant to put out good products and to regain their position as a market leader (earned this time and not strong-armed).

0,It&#x27;s quite exciting to see these sorts of papers.<p>What fascinates me is that we have achieved so much in the &quot;quantum age&quot; of the past century using the models derived from a quantum mechanical approach to physics. That the bedrock [or lack of one] of that could be removed and provide a better more consistent approach seems so counter-intuitive. But then one recalls how long the Newtonian or Aristotelian approaches [or any other such system] stood.<p>Also would this be a return to universal models with an aether: wonder how Michelson-Morley works with &quot;flux tubes&quot;?
0,How about using whatever is in our powers (legally) to punish Sony for their complete apathy towards security? That&#x27;s why these documents were leaked in the first place.<p>Security (and privacy as a result) is something hugely important to customers whether they know it or not but not so important to corporations except for how it might damage their bottom line from backlash.<p>If we don&#x27;t show them how they can also suffer from bad security practices then nothing will ever be done to fix it. I am 100% certain that Sony and many other large organizations are now spending a hell of a lot more money on their security teams.

0,I think it&#x27;s a <i>hard</i> business model that&#x27;s for sure.<p>Most people here think that Freemium works because you have Open Source developers who have &#x27;day jobs&#x27; which means they&#x27;ll be more likely to buy the private services. That&#x27;s a bit of a stretch because it&#x27;s mostly development managers who choose the development tools at any reasonable size company and they have a lot of other concerns.<p>There&#x27;s also a scaling issue in model. A flat fee for a repository doesn&#x27;t go much of a way towards paying for the total cost of developing and delivering a complete web platform where your costs scale by number of developers and infrastructure.<p>The major thing in Githubs favour is they are now <i>the place</i> for Open Source development so they have other revenue opportunities. I can imagine good revenue opportunities with large partners (e.g Microsoft) that want to reach out to developers: separately their large database of developers is a big asset for other services. Presumably the VC money is predicated on new revenue streams over time.

Part of the hassle of mass transit is that if you need to make 3 transfers and have to wait 10 minutes at each one your commute gets long fast.  Extending the NYC Subway in NJ would have several benefits including reducing the slow crawl through the Lincoln tunnel where almost 7000 busses cram in daily.

0,I believe that is exactly the idea.<p>Google as the ecosystem provider (ChromeOS) does not really want to compete with the companies that are intended to use the OS.<p>Google does not want to compete with Dell HP Lenovo or Acer but to convince them to use ChromeOS.<p>Google creates hardware as a reference for others to follow. This is very important as there is a before an after the release of the Nexus phone.<p>Google releases high quality hardware with their OS to prove that a good machine could be make with it but at a price that does not compete with others.

0,Although I&#x27;m involved in both these enterprises let&#x27;s not confuse their goals.<p>CommonMark is currently focused on the task of giving a decent spec for the core syntax and robust efficient implementations; extensions will wait til that project is done but certainly aren&#x27;t ruled out.<p>Pandoc has <i>always</i> been in the game of extending the feature set.  Here are just some of the Markdown extensions pandoc supports:  LaTeX math (which can be rendered in a variety of formats including native Word and MathML) LaTeX macros inline LaTeX automatically numbered examples and cross-references to these automatically generated citations (using CSL styles) super and subscripts strikeout figures YAML metadata definition lists several styles of tables fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting header identifiers and footnotes.  scholdoc just adds a few things on top of all this (and many of them could be implemented in pandoc filters).  As noted in one of the other comments on this thread most of the features scholdoc adds are under active discussion in pandoc as well.  So it&#x27;s not that pandoc and scholdoc have different aims; pandoc just moves more slowly because it has to worry about how features are implemented in many more output formats and it operates under some other constraints that scholdoc rejects (e.g. trying to avoid the use of English words like &quot;Figure&quot; for syntax cues).

That accomplishment would be surpassed many times over by even one technology that could be used to refine coal or bunker fuel to make it cleaner-burning in the existing infrastructure at or near the same price per ton.

0,Yes those of us who did not already know this long-standing fact learned it yesterday.  What many of us seem to have failed to absorb is that water supplies are compartmentalized in such a way that saving in one area does not necessarily improve the situation in another area.  One city can run out of water while another has plenty.  Many cities have dedicated water supplies that are in no way connected to nor shared with agriculture so saving even 100% of agricultural water provides no benefit for the municipal supplies.

0,Economics is <i>not</i> value-free. Actually economics already has a way of dealing with exactly the problem GP cites: externalities.<p>Taking away someone&#x27;s <i>home</i> involves potentially massive negative externalities (emotional and otherwise). Therefore if you want to maintain the political theater that says capitalism is designed to benefit everyone you have to accept that it may be preferable optimal in fact to incur some deadweight loss. Rent control is one strategy that does just that: as long as a person lives in a place the rent can&#x27;t go up.<p>Is it naively optimal? Nope. But it is (or can be if you get the implementation right) <i>actually</i> optimal. It is a guarantee that a house <i>can be</i> a home if the tenant so chooses and it <i>could</i> be used to balance the aforementioned negative externalities.<p>Does it? Who knows maybe I&#x27;m not familiar enough with San Francisco&#x27;s housing laws. Just because they implemented it poorly doesn&#x27;t mean the concept is unsound or irrational and it doesn&#x27;t mean that anyone in favor of the concept is &quot;silly&quot; or deserves to be condescended.

0,<i>&gt; At the beginning of his presidency he promoted an amendment to the constitution which would have permanently protect slavery and forbid it from being outlawed.</i><p>There were several such measures being mooted during the &quot;secession crisis&quot; of 1861 when the Southern states were still in the union but threatening to pull out. (See for example the Corwin Amendment: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corwin_Amendment" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corwin_Amendment</a>) They were all desperate attempts to forestall secession by pre-emptively giving the South what it was thought they wanted. Once secession went from being a threat to an actual fact there was no point to such measures anymore and they were all quickly dropped.<p>Given the scope of the tragedy that the war would bring it&#x27;s not hard to have sympathy for leaders who grasped for something anything that could stop it from happening. But that&#x27;s all these proposals were -- frantic attempts to head off a looming disaster. They don&#x27;t reflect actual policy preferences.<p><i>&gt; On another occasion he suggested that blacks should be exiled back to Africa.</i><p>Indeed he did raise the issue of &quot;colonization&quot; (as it was called at the time) at several points early in his presidency. It&#x27;s not like he invented the idea; it was a common proposal among Northern conservatives among whom the only thing less popular than black slavery was black people themselves. But he never pushed it hard because it was the conservatives&#x27; idea not really his; and besides nobody was enthusiastic about it least of all Northern blacks. His Administration never put the muscle behind it they put behind say passing the 13th Amendment.<p><i>&gt;  I could cite many more of his words making it abundantly clear he was not in favor of black equality.</i><p>You&#x27;re conflating black <i>emancipation</i> with black <i>equality</i> which to white 19th century Americans were two very different things. Emancipation was broadly popular in the North but that didn&#x27;t mean Northerners saw blacks as their equals in any real respect. They thought they were inferior creatures but inferior creatures who shouldn&#x27;t be enslaved.<p>Lincoln never got to the point where he embraced equality as strongly as he embraced emancipation but by the end of the war he&#x27;d gotten closer to it than any other American statesman of his age -- or of the next 100 years for that matter. Certainly he felt more for African-Americans as human beings than did any President for decades after.<p><i>&gt; Why if there was such a coalition was it necessary for Lincoln to ignore the supreme court&#x27;s decision against the illegal ending of habeus corpus arrest and exile a congress man and imprison countless northern journalists who wrote opposing the war?</i><p>Because there was a <i>civil war</i> going on and as a practical fact he had to keep border states like Maryland and Kentucky from being dragged out of the union if he wanted to win it. There was no way around that fact. To lose the border states would have been to lose the whole game. So when hardness was necessary he was willing to be hard.

0,[Lawyer but not a patent lawyer]<p>I was perplexed by the uproar on HN about the original patent language (in the thread announcing the release of React Native [1]). This kind of open-source patent license--which in effect allows Facebook to use its patents against users of React defensively but not offensively--is exactly what we need more of in the open source world. Why did people think that their defensive patent license was somehow worse than the industry standard (the MIT or BSD copyright license with no patent license which made patent rights murky at best)?<p>But this new language eliminates the major limitation on the original language which was that the license would be terminated if you attempted to invalidate one of Facebook&#x27;s patents or defensively argued that it was invalid or unenforceable (or even according to a strict though implausible reading of the language if you publicly stated that the patent was invalid).<p>Glad to see Facebook paying attention even if the original complaint was overblown.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9271246" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9271246</a>

In any other credit purchase if the service bought turn out to not be what is promised you have recourse you and default file bankruptcy or even sue. You can&#x27;t do that with a college education you&#x27;re effectively buying it sight unseen with no recourse or remedy and that debt lives on forever and ever.<p>If we made it so college debt was like normal debt meaning it could be discharged in bankruptcy the cost of a higher education would likely plummet and come back down into the affordable range again.

You can watch them for free right now.<p>I feel your frustration that they don&#x27;t fund certain things but this should not be called crushing morale.<p>Please remember one thing: the reason YCombinator is a monopoly is that others are cowardly don&#x27;t know how to invest at the seed stage and help founders build huge scalable businesses with a community of awesome people around them.  This community is a hallmark of YC and one of the obvious things that must be true about any founding group that has at least 2 members is that by definition they are social enough to keep a group of at least 2 cofounders together.<p>If you feel YCombinator is a monopoly you have to please by having a cofounder why don&#x27;t you get a cofounder?

To the extent they do so they can reasonably capture a share of those gains.<p>But once they are trusted in that capacity they are now in a position to take money by less-honest means in a manner largely indistinguishable from their legitimate functions by the casual observer.

0,The maximum command line size allowed by the Linux kernel used to be 128kB. This might sound crazy but that limit was a real constraint for some Google services. My guess is that this is referring to a kernel patch to increase the maximum size.<p>This is a somewhat educated guess. A long time ago at Google I used to work on the program that was used to launch most jobs on the clusters. To help mitigate the command line length problems the launcher preferred generating command lines with -nofoo instead of --foo=false and -foo instead of -foo=true. This saved a few characters per boolean flag. Of course it also caused no end of trouble for people who&#x27;d defined their own &quot;three-state boolean&quot; flags that could e.g. be true&#x2F;false&#x2F;autodetect. Not the finest hour of engineering in retrospect.

0,Anywhere around the accelerator you are going to have massive cyclotron radiation ( ie. the photons emitted when you coerce of near light speed proton out of a straight line).<p>In addition at the detectors themselves you have all sorts of radiation from the collisions. Muon gamma etc.<p>The author does pass on a good point the biggest danger is oxygen deprivation from liquid helium argon and I assume Nitrogen ( though not mentioned ).

Canal diggers in the north were paid very little often in rum and died from disease so quickly and were replaced by a constant churn of immigrants. Doing that kind of work with slaves would be much more costly.

0,No-voting Vancouverite here.<p>Firstly giving more money to Translink is like giving a credit card to a reckless teenager. Or the keys to a powerful sports car to Justin Bieber. Secondly transit should support itself from the fares it collects: how about that! I already pay a &quot;regional transit levy&quot; ... in my electricity bill WTF? Where is the connection between me running a fridge computer and lights and someone else taking the bus?<p>I don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass about transit.  I bike to work!<p>Okay so there are bike lanes in this deal for me? Nope; I don&#x27;t care about those and they won&#x27;t build them where I commute. I will fend for myself thanks.<p>I also don&#x27;t care about expanding the road infrastructure for motorists. Roads should get slower and more congested as an incentive for people to get out of their cars.<p>My commute is already short and consistently so. I can beat transit by 100% and even the average car trip time. I&#x27;ve made the 12 km trip to work in as few as 22 minutes; whereas my best car time was around 15 and plenty of times when traffic made that 45 minutes or more.<p>I don&#x27;t care about a new bridge over the Fraser; just more ways for the violent criminals from there to attack Vancouver homes businesses and individuals and then make a faster getaway back over the Fraser out of law&#x27;s reach.  It&#x27;s bad enough that a stray bullet can reach across the Fraser.<p>Hey that last paragraph is a joke no offense intended! :)

0,You are already doing that in a normal template. Let us say you are building a shopping cart.<p>The template will contain logic like an iteration over what has currently been put in the basket. And maybe some condition that if the basket is empty you should show a friendly string instead. Then you have some additional logic in a js file that will collapse the list of items if the user does not want to see everything. This is usually done by using a id&#x2F;class or html element to grab on to.<p>The idea behind React is that you put all possible states and ways the view can render in a component. You still would (generally) not have actual logic in it; like grabbing data from the server or calculating stuff.<p>It is different yes but I think it is a neat idea. We will have to see if it is a viable path forward but I think this &quot;rethinking best practices&quot; is really good and has already influenced the rest of the frameworks quite a lot.

0,One reason to keep reading man pages is because you will likely discover new thing you did not expected.  Also reading man pages help you to understand the tool philosophy&#x2F;workflow if the man page is well writen (which is often the case).  This hold for any kind of documentation as well.<p>When I google something I usually do not remember the answer to my question the only thing I remember is the keyword to put in my futur query to get the same answer.  You will get your answer quicker but you wont learn much.  So personally I prefer reading man pages (when I can) than use google.

0,1. Do not take legal advice from the internet. If you are concerned about legal trouble and can afford to do so find an attorney in your area that you can consult with for an hour on this. (They might appreciate the laugh.) Even if you can&#x27;t afford to do so make a few calls. You might get lucky and find someone willing to do a brief consult for a little less. Also attorneys happen to specialize in writing scary sounding letters that have the unique ability to make nuisances go away.<p>2. Give oDesk some more time. It may take them a day or two to retrieve their head from their ass.<p>3. Set up a filter to route this fool&#x27;s messages to your junk folder where it belongs.<p>4. Consider this an education in the quality of customers that oDesk cultivates and think hard about whether or not you could make more money for less trouble elsewhere.<p>5. I&#x27;m unfamiliar with Indian law (again you should be talking to an attorney not HN) but there may be some state agency you can contact regarding this guy. I once made a nuisance write an apologetic letter and then go away forever by contacting my state&#x27;s attorney general&#x27;s office and filing a complaint. It took all of less than two hours of my time and no money for the nuisance to receive a scary-sounding warning from the state.<p>In my totally-not-a-lawyer opinion this guy is a scammer and I&#x27;d simply ignore him and not lose any sleep over it until and unless he started demanding my attention elsewhere in which case he would get my full and undivided attention for as long as it took to make him run away.

0,The notion that memory leaks do not constitute memory unsafety has been the party line for a long time since last year at least (since we can&#x27;t prevent memory leaks statically: imagine sending something across a channel to a deadlocked thread (remembering that Rust cannot statically prevent deadlocks in general only data races)). The disruption this week has been due to a stdlib API that made use of a very specific pattern involving a mix of unsafe code ownership transfer and destructors. Previously it was believed that this particular unsafe code could not lead to memory unsafety but that happens to be untrue when memory leakage is thrown into the mix. As a result of this coming to light people will need to reevaluate unsafe code in destructors in a way that had previously not been considered which is why there&#x27;s been a general tizzy about it.

0,This seems unworkable.<p>Why 10% and not say 90%? Or 100%? (100% and maintain a GPA seems the most workable.)<p>What about someone in the 50% range who decides after 10 years in the workforce to go to college? With no second chances this is the tyranny of the Permanent Record.<p>What about someone who gets a GED to graduate early to start college early; or someone who had to drop out to support the family and then get a GED finish high school and go on to college? What of home schoolers?<p>I can also envision school swapping. If I&#x27;m at the border of 10% in a very good school then in my last semester (after the submissions for college have gone out) of school I could switch schools to an academically poorer high school and have a much better chance of getting the grade. It&#x27;s worth $40000 in tuition money so some people will do it.<p>Or in my case I took a lot of classes in high school including some that were dual-enrolled with the local community college. While AP calculus had an extra boost in the GPA calculation my differential equations class did not. What luck it would be if by taking more advanced unweighted classes I happen to be below the 10% mark filled by those who maximized GPA instead of education.

0,Yes it&#x27;s very important that people who work in the language be able to read and understand it easily. It is not however important that people who do not work in the language be able to do so. The most persistent critique of Haskell is that it is hard to understand for people who haven&#x27;t learned it. This is as reasonable as critiquing Java because it is hard to understand for people who do not know how to program. You&#x27;re welcome to claim that Haskell has a larger barrier to entry but that is a fundamentally different claim from the claim that operators make the language harder to read for practitioners. I have been attempting to refute the latter claim using my experience discussing the issue with said practitioners. If you want to discuss the former claim I&#x27;m happy to do that as well but you have to acknowledge that it is a separate claim and be clear about what it is you actually mean.

0,&gt; (I really hate the phrase &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; by the way because it simply isn&#x27;t a good way to describe democratic voting where the majority is emergent and not determined ex ante.)<p>Nothing about the phrase actually requires the tyranny be remotely permanent and nothing about the concept of tyranny requires it either. Indeed it&#x27;s actually more poignant that the tyranny is both ephemeral and more importantly inevitable. This is the real issue. It&#x27;s easy to comprehend the issue by looking at semi-permanent states [1] like Marxist class divisions or political polarization but those are <i>consequences</i>.<p>When you place something to a vote and fail to achieve consensus you have a majority whose will is being enacted upon a minority. This is commonly celebrated by moronic catchphrases such as &quot;the right side of history&quot; but you still have a winner and a loser. And when the ephemeral majority seems to crystallize from the aether into an unmistakable demographic of some kind you really have to wonder about this &quot;emergent majority&quot; concept.<p>The fundamental American problem is that it is incapable of trusting its government. (I can&#x27;t speak to other governments; I don&#x27;t live under those.) This lack of trust is well-founded but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less crippling. I said below that the appropriate counter to the tyrannical majority is a strong executive. The executive is capable of saying &quot;No&quot; to a popular opinion in a way that the legislature cannot. (Indeed this is a role Americans have shoved onto the judiciary which means we can&#x27;t actually say no until someone files a lawsuit.) The interplay between the legislature and the executive (the vote the veto the super-majority overrule the refusal to enforce the impeachment) is exactly the solution being proposed.<p>None of it works without an executive willing to exercise its options. See Obama&#x27;s refusal to enforce immigration laws for instance. (For the sake of this &quot;academic debate&quot; let&#x27;s presume that he could enforce them to the letter if he wanted to.) That is a check against tyranny of the majority. So naturally well... see for yourself [2]. This isn&#x27;t meant as an anti-Republican statement; it&#x27;s just the most recent example I could bring to mind off the top of my head.<p>The trust part comes back when you ask &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t a minority group tyrannized by a majority group just leave?&quot; You know secede. This comes back to the emergent majority you spoke of: if you trust the majority to you know not be dicks about it [3]. To not <i>always</i> be the majority then secession isn&#x27;t necessary. You can expect that the issues will change and you&#x27;ll be in the majority. Of course what&#x27;s happened with the polarized political class in America is that you stick around because you figure you can <i>win</i> next time.<p>This is a problem. It is the exact opposite of what you need to make sure that a majority is an emergent majority. Instead of melting back into an indeterminate goo and forming new majority&#x2F;minority groups in each vote you have battle lines being drawn for a budding civil war. And that&#x27;s as far as I&#x27;ve figured out.<p>[1] &quot;State&quot; as in &quot;state of being&quot; not as in &quot;nation-state&quot;.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

0,&gt; From technological perspective of course it have never been easier. On the other hand since everybody [0] can now create a game the competition between game developers is much stronger which is arguably a good thing for gamers but not necessarily for developers. Also from consumer point of view signal to noise ratio will probably get worse (many inexperienced designer flooding marked with their first games etc.).<p>This isn&#x27;t the first time the games industry has seen a flood of games and it won&#x27;t be the last.  I suspect the bar to attract consumer interest will rise and things will return to how they once were - with the ease of development being supplanted by the difficulties of the new quality bars.  As curation catches up to the rest of the industry (or we see another crash and the flood abates) the S&#x2F;N ratio will improve back towards old levels - if you follow the right channels.<p>The size of large game studios to the best of my knowledge has never been bigger than now.  The size of the market when everyone has a smartphone in their pocket has never been bigger than now.  Entirely new markets (first mobile now VR) are opening up.  Devs are doing OK at least.<p>I&#x27;d say the sheer enormity required to develop AAA titles might make it hard for e.g. the next John Carmack to make their millions on their own but Minecraft selling for $2.5B pokes... at least a few holes in that theory.

0,Some great passages in there.  This one could have been written today:<p><pre><code>   One of the peculiar phenomena of our time is the    renegade Liberal. Over and above the familiar Marxist    claim that &#x27;bourgeois liberty&#x27; is an illusion there is    now a widespread tendency to argue that one can only    defend democracy by totalitarian methods. If one loves    democracy the argument runs one must crush its enemies    by no matter what means. And who are its enemies? It    always appears that they are not only those who attack    it openly and consciously but those who &#x27;objectively&#x27;    endanger it by spreading mistaken doctrines. In other    words defending democracy involves destroying all    independence of thought. This argument was used for    instance to justify the Russian purges. The most ardent    Russophile hardly believed that all of the victims were    guilty of all the things they were accused of. but by    holding heretical opinions they &#x27;objectively&#x27; harmed the    régime and therefore it was quite right not only to    massacre them but to discredit them by false    accusations. The same argument was used to justify the    quite conscious lying that went on in the leftwing press    about the Trotskyists and other Republican minorities in    the Spanish civil war. And it was used again as a reason    for yelping against habeas corpus when Mosley was    released in 1943.   These people don&#x27;t see that if you encourage    totalitarian methods the time may come when they will    be used against you instead of for you...</code></pre>

It&#x27;s currently in beta I&#x27;m waiting for custom domain support and apps. The complete focus on &quot;but Americans are protected&quot; as an excuse for the NSA spying makes me actively seek out local services that are privacy aware. I use Telegram with encrypted chats for many conversations now. I found this service as an alternative to digital ocean: Transip.nl. I do wonder how my rights are when I pick an Amsterdam based data center for my droplet though. I know MS actively protected user data from Ireland which is good whatever their reasons are.I also switched to using mobile websites in mobile FF instead of installing many intrusive apps. Mobile responsive website are often as good as apps and better for sharing links.

0,&gt; Indeed it&#x27;s actually more poignant that the tyranny is both ephemeral and more importantly inevitable. This is the real issue. It&#x27;s easy to comprehend the issue by looking at semi-permanent states [1] like Marxist class divisions or political polarization but those are consequences.<p>I disagree; if the oppression is ephemeral then it&#x27;s nowhere as bad as when it is (semi)permanent. (Maybe an example would help - all the oppressions that come to my mind from history that were formalized in law are attempts to permanently subjugate or even eradicate the minority.)<p>(In fact I can come up with an example of &quot;ephemeral&quot; oppression - unemployment. It&#x27;s irony that people who argue that democracy leads to tyranny of majority often fail to see the tyranny of the markets.)<p>People do have empathy and memory; if you being in the minority is ephemeral then you will remember it and vote differently. Oppression can only work if people are afraid; if they are not they can change things and work toward consensus.<p>And if you look at direct democracy in Switzerland for instance you will find that direct democracy (I don&#x27;t consider representative democracy only one or the best possibility) actually leads to more consensual result - people vote differently on different issues sometimes they have minority view mostly they have majority view (as it happens statistically) and because of that the party or class tribalism you describe from American politics is greatly reduced. So empirically exact opposite happens than what &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; crowd tends to think that happens. (Another counterfactual claim is that direct democracy will lead to some torrent of crazy changes - in fact common voters are more conservative and less decisive than politicians.)<p>&gt; This is a problem. It is the exact opposite of what you need to make sure that a majority is an emergent majority.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what is your point here. In direct democracy the majority is always emergent; it depends on your actual views not on which party you decide to vote for.

0,Automated trading has reduced bid&#x2F;ask spreads significantly (usually to the regulated minimum of one cent for popular issues). This is a compelling benefit for individual investors.<p>It has negatively impacted investors doing large trades but those investors generally have more tools at their disposal to break their trades into smaller groups or whatever. The major example impact I&#x27;ve heard is that the larger investors can&#x27;t look at the order books at all the markets and issue one order (to one exchange?) and take all the orders.<p>It seems that the automated players are duplicating their orders at multiple exchanges and removing or replacing orders at other exchanges when one fills.  A simple solution would be for the large investor to send individual orders to each exchange and pace them so they arrive simultaneously at each exchange (instead of sending them simultaneously); of course if you do that often enough automated traders will probably put out smaller orders or do less duplication.

0,&gt; Bitpesa exist undercutting remittance<p>Bitpesa takes 3% significantly more than a credit card transaction and much more than many established low-risk remittance corridors (e.g. Arabian Peninsula -&gt; India&#x2F;Pakistan Europe -&gt; Central America are all under 1%). True many remittance flows can be 9% or more but that&#x27;s because they have significant levels of fraud and the overhead of KYC regulation. Ignoring fraud and regulations means you can reduce fees obviously.<p>&gt; merchant processors like Coinbase all undercut any creditcard<p>Coinbase charges 1% to buy and another 1% to sell and users are responsible for all bitcoin transaction fees. This revenue means that it can charge nothing for coinbase -&gt; coinbase transfers; however nearly all financial institutions charge nothing for intra-bank transfers.<p>&gt; companies like Microsoft accept bitcoin and keep more profits<p>About 0% of Microsoft&#x27;s revenues are in Bitcoin this increases Microsoft profits by about 0%.

0,I believe the issue is less that advertisers are unwilling to buy display web ads; it&#x27;s more that they no longer place a premium value on buying them from branded publishers when they can reach the same users on many different websites with programmatic buying.<p>This hugely devalues quality publishers and increases the value of lower-investment publishers who successfully create a lot of pageviews. The latter inventory used to sell for bottom-of-the-barrel prices but advertisers have decided it&#x27;s pretty similar in value to reaching the same user on a high-quality site.<p>The best offensive weapon quality websites have against this trend is native advertising: create high-quality sponsorship offerings that commodity display ad impressions can&#x27;t directly compete with.

I went to a vegan advocacy organization event a few months ago where this topic came up and other attendees shared my enthusiasm for this kind of research but the diversity of views and motivations in the vegan community makes me wary of claiming that that means this is mainstream.<p>To answer your correlation question probably yes -- but vegans&#x27; attitudes toward &quot;tampering with nature&quot; vary widely from the view that it&#x27;s the worst possible thing humanity can do on through to the view that it&#x27;s the <i>best</i> possible thing humanity can do (e.g. David Pearce) with a broad spectrum in between.  (I don&#x27;t have an ideal example of the former group in mind but I could mention Sea Shepherd&#x27;s Paul Watson who advocates deep ecology and opposes GMOs.)<p>I think we will see sharper divisions between environmentalist vegans (especially advocates of deep ecology) and animal rights&#x2F;animal welfare vegans over time.  I don&#x27;t know how the population breaks down in the west today or how many people have even had to think about it that much.

One of the points the post brings up is that there is only a very small group of people who have access to the Microsoft kernel code the driver code and the game code.  On Linux this pool is vast.  With open source kernel and open source drivers game developers can dig all the way through the stack to understand the entire system.  I would hope this leads to better APIs that expose the nature of the system directly and not having to impose workarounds for specific games inside the driver itself.

0,Sys Admin&#x2F;Engineer here.  We had it right 15 years ago.  You couldn&#x27;t become an admin unless you started as a programmer.  You needed a deep understanding of your OS and good knowledge of C.  At that time the devs (&quot;programmers&quot;) were less knowledgeable than sys admins.  You had to have to skills to analysis debug and fix their code.  When sys admins stopped coding the result was weaker admins.  Sys admins ought to code within their domain engineer and maintain their systems for performance and high availability.  It is long over due that sys admins return to their roots and get ahead of the pack.

0,The mass is almost almost almost conserved in chemical reactions. By special relativity the energy&#x2F;heat that produces the reaction should come from a extremely slightly difference of mass between the reagents and the products. The difference is so small that in any chemical class and chemical application you just assume that they are equal. (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conservation_of_mass#The_mass_associated_with_chemical_amounts_of_energy_is_too_small_to_measure" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conservation_of_mass#The_mass_a...</a> )<p>For example a person consumes approximately 2000 kcal&#x2F;day of food. The calculation is more complicated because not all the energy is used. But for the sake of the argument let&#x27;s assume that the person just use all the 2000 kcal and they are lost as heat work (lifting a heavy object  moving the air moving the water while swimming ... )<p>Using the famous E=mc^2 equation we have that m=2000 kcal&#x2F;c^2 = 9E-8 grams = 3E-9 ounces. That&#x27;s very small and is not useful for a diet but it&#x27;s not zero.

It&#x27;s supported by a more general world view. Ravens are animals and children tend to resemble their parents in particular birds of a given species tend to have the same color scheme. If we occasionally observe a white crow that will tend to make us more inclined to believe there may be white ravens out there even though ravens are not crows.

0,There is so much wrong with this post. I&#x27;ll follow your ordering.<p>1. Program WHATEVER you want. We can&#x27;t make assumptions about what drives you. If popularity is your biggest drive then use it. Don&#x27;t ignore what drives you because you think one way is more honorable than the next. Do what you need to do. No one cares why you do something if you do a good job.<p>2. Fine.<p>3. Anyone who judges on stars is normal. They may also be an idiot. But in most cases stars WILL impress your prospective employers. This may not be a GOOD thing but it is true. It is just how humans think. Go with the tide not against it but certainly the popularity ratings are not all important. Use them to help you advertise yourself but don&#x27;t rely on them solely.<p>4. If you are a beginner there is NOTHING you have out there a prospective employer would not benefit from seeing. Most people I see starting out have so little. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the project is unfinished. Most projects ARE unfinished. If you just came out of school your prospective employer should be understanding of your priorities.<p>5. Fine.<p>Now onto the next list but a general note first. WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT. Our entire economy is based around survival of the fittest (for the most part). Create the next best * (language OS api db etc) or don&#x27;t you still learned a hell of a lot (I hope). Jumping into things with which you are unfamiliar is AWESOME. You WILL be rewarded.<p>Anyway the next list:<p>1. As with everything else if you want to do this do it. You will learn about lexing parsing (because God knows most people can&#x27;t tell the two apart) ASTs the difference between a compiler and an interpreter. At the very least you will be the more intelligent voice at <i>Your Generic Job</i> when talking about Python&#x27;s awkward scoping.<p>2. Write WHATEVER you want. Now truthfully you probably won&#x27;t get far. But if you learn what a kernel is what a boot sector is etc you will be far ahead of most other programmers out there. Will this be helpful in your career? Probably not. But WHO cares! You&#x27;ll learn some good C skills at least.<p>3. Write WHATEVER you want! Honestly a simple database is probably the simplest of the three mentioned topics (language OS). New databases are always being written.<p>Ultimately the point is always that although you <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t beat the existing implementations you WILL learn a lot about how they work. There is nothing more helpful (IMHO) when learning a new topic&#x2F;api&#x2F;etc than writing it from scratch. Move on when you understand the concepts. Certainly don&#x27;t use your project in production <i>probably</i> but it doesn&#x27;t mean you didn&#x27;t learn anything!<p>4. Fine.<p>5. Fine.<p>Point is these lists come off as incredibly narrow-minded. A beginner should do what interests them. While their projects <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t take off these are the most important things to show to employers down the road. This will demonstrate your interest in CS your ability to take on a challenging project and for crying out loud it gives you code samples. Email me if you have questions.<p>&#x2F;rant

You don&#x27;t need a fancy accountant. Just either:<p>1) Move to a foreign country and get a job there.<p>2) Buy a bunch of tax exempt bonds.<p>These aren&#x27;t people with high paying jobs somehow magically not paying taxes on them.

All of these things can be visualized in the mind as a sequence of environmental first person perspective imagery with emotional associations and connected knowledge that comes in the form of feelings and constructed symbolic representations of reality.<p>We put things together almost instantaneously without even understanding how we fill in the gaps. The same mechanism occurs when one jumps to conclusions or understands how one line of a mathematical proof implies that the next line can now be read. It&#x27;s all absurd and has the potential to be brain exploding when you really sit and try to think about what makes you think that gap is totally filled but it&#x27;s also not because memories and feelings like &#x27;obvious&#x27; and also because it&#x27;s a big part of science to question those gaps.<p>Brains are weird though even with all the explanation and science and repetition and predictability in scientific knowledge it is still &#x27;awe&#x27; invoking.

0,Lodash is what finally made me get functional programming because I was able to start using it in small places where it made sense as opposed to diving into it all at once. At first it started out with just map and filter for some basic cases. Then I would peruse the Lodash docs now and then and discover functions that could replace a lot of my iterative often messy code with something that felt much more elegant especially with chaining.<p>With that new-found knowledge I decided to make my 4th or 5th attempt at trying to grasp clojure and ran through some 4clojure problems. This time I breezed through the problems and in many cases enjoyed writing it more than I would have in a typical iterative style. I made sure to follow some recommended users to see their solutions as well which helped reduce much of my parentheses bloat.<p>My favorite thing about using high order functions has been that provided your underlying functions are tested&#x2F;correct you can more easily reason about and test your new functions particularly when you keep things immutable&#x2F;side-effect free.<p>I&#x27;m sure I would have gotten to this point eventually without Lodash but being able to make use of bits and pieces at a time was a major catalyst for me.

Really paleo vs any nutrition advice that&#x27;s more than 10 years old (so the science had a chance to check the claims)<p>IMO we don&#x27;t currently know enough about nutrition or the microbiome to make a better choice than &quot;whatever our great-great-great grandparents did&quot;<p>&gt; Do you think they all had the same microbiome?<p>They didn&#x27;t but they had way more diversity and significantly different strains than moderns do.

0,Go is a drastically different language than Java. And porting over Java&#x27;s GC wouldn&#x27;t make sense.<p>In Java everything except primitive types is a <i>pointer</i>. In Go on the other hand programming &quot;by value&quot; is encouraged (pointers are explicit never implicit). In Go it&#x27;s possible to actually <i>avoid</i> creating garbage altogether - you have a decent amount of control of where memory gets allocated.<p>Thus porting Java&#x27;s GC which has been highly optimized to deal with hundreds of short-lived objects whose allocation you as a Java programmer have no control over wouldn&#x27;t make sense - it&#x27;s optimized in all the wrong places for Go basically.

0,&gt;Excel destroys any csv file upon saving.<p>This isn&#x27;t exactly true although I understand why people think it is. The problem is that when you &quot;open&quot; a csv file in Excel it guesses what type the fields are and sets that datatype for the column. This will frequently mangle the data when written back to a file as you noted.<p>However you can &quot;import&quot; the csv file using the wizard and that allows you to set all of the options including datatype. Setting this to &#x27;text&#x27; seems to prevent Excel from mangling the data.<p>I tend to use a combination of CSVKit which seems plenty fast for my usage and Excel when dealing with csv files.

The HR warlords for all those defense&#x2F;aero companies that have set these limits have done so because it segments the pool of candidates to one with a lower chance of bust (or so they&#x27;ve decided as such).<p>I&#x27;d like to see data I&#x27;m some HR or consulting group somewhere has it. Or maybe it doesnt exist. A simple logistic regression problem with a high number of variables (degree or not age major self-study continuing ed etc etc).<p>edit: also - all my comments are speaking from the engineering side of these companies. not IT.

The justification footer was a joke: &quot;You are receiving this mail because of your function in the company&quot;. -- You&#x27;re supposed to tell that the mail is opt-in jackasses.<p>Most office workers know about &quot;ACF Management&quot; in Quebec because of the relentless spam and I&#x27;m not surprised they&#x27;re the first hit by CASL.

0,Yeah I&#x27;ve been doing something close to twice 70p or so for some time... I&#x27;m curious what are other people&#x27;s food budgets?<p>In the morning I have some oatmeal with milk. The oatmeal&#x27;s about 20p for a pack and I use about 1&#x2F;5th of the pack. Milk&#x27;s 50c per liter and I think I use about an 8th or so. I also have a Banana about 20p. So breakfast is about 30p.<p>Lunch is pretty light I&#x27;ll go with a pair of sandwiches with peanut butter and the 2nd piece of fruit that&#x27;ll cost me probably about 40p or so. Water&#x27;s the drink of choice.<p>70p so far. (this is all Euros btw).<p>Then in the evening it&#x27;ll be two dishes for me the main dish (carbs vegs proteine very roughly seen) and a small salad.<p>For the main dish: carbs which are always the cheapest. 10 grams of rice costs less than a penny so an average portion is about 10p. Other carbs like pasta or potatoes are pretty similar in cost. Then there&#x27;s vegetables can be anything really. Another 100 gram portion of say Broccoli is about 15p same for alternatives like zucchini or endive. And finally there&#x27;s protein like fish or chicken. I tend to go 2 times chicken 1 times beef 2 times fish 2 times vegetarian in a 7 day week. Aiming more of the latter. This&#x27;ll set me back about 60c for meats a little less for fish unless it&#x27;s salmon. Getting protein from a veg meal is much much cheaper in the form of various beans. My main dinner averages about 65p.<p>In addition there&#x27;s the salad. Bit of cucumber tomato lettuce carrot. It&#x27;s about 50p or so all in all. Then add about 20p for the whole dinner in herbs onion garlic olive oil vinegar etc. And it&#x27;s about 1.35 for dinner with 30p breakfast and 40p lunch.<p>So yeah 2.05 for food in a day. About 1.50 pounds in the UK. Twice what the guy spent but I consider it a pretty balanced meal no white loaves or lemonade or tinned anything really. Literally have had a salad for every day of my life for decades now. Never overweight (even during a sedentary lifestyle working from a home office as a freelancer and not working out at all) yet I eat 3 pretty solid meals two portions of fruit and two portions of vegetables enough carbs not much sugar decent fats in oils and fish protein etc.<p>I&#x27;d like to add nuts throughout the day and eat more vegetables rather than bread for the lunch and go from 3 days meat to 2 days meat at least but otherwise I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.<p>Anyway I grew up on this could easily spend more and I do spend a lot on other stuff but I keep my main food on a budget for some reason. It really puts everything into perspective like a $2 bag of chips I can easily power through during a movie that&#x27;s the entire day&#x27;s food budget equivalent.

0,Interesting points.<p>1. Caching content-distribution-networks and possibly shared-libraries could solve or at least ameliorate this.<p>2. This is relatively easy. The sandboxed code could &quot;open&quot; handles by calling into an API and the code could &quot;close&quot; them when no longer needed.<p>3. In many cases the GC is tied intimately to the semantics of the language so enforcing a style of GC could be too limiting in terms of performance. Instead it could be better to implement a GC&#x27;ed VM on top of the low-level one.<p>The biggest problem is to get something like this turned into a standard and accepted in all browsers. Perhaps a viable route is to write the standard of this low-level virtual machine for the web (LLVM&#x2F;W) on top of ASM.js (and implement threading by emulation) and then wait for general acceptance and for browser vendors to implement LLVM&#x2F;W directly.

0,I have to agree. There&#x27;s nothing you need Perl for and nothing it specifically offers. Like if you want to do something in Wordpress you can only use PHP no choice. If you want to code a Linux driver you have to use C. If you want nice features like awesome readability you choose Python. If you want awesome power you use some kind of Lisp or Haskell.<p>There is not a single (well known) reason for using Perl. Even if it&#x27;s 10% better and faster than any other language without a unique selling point the cost of switching is just too high in most cases.

The codebase is clean methods are easy to reason about. It not as verbose as Java would be there&#x27;s no monkey-patching like you might see in Ruby refactoring is much safer than it would be in JavaScript and it runs on Linux much better than C# would. And thanks to FP the code is thread-safe and mostly free of side-effects (except where they&#x27;re explicitly required). I wouldn&#x27;t trade Scala for any other language for this kind of work.

Buyers that get a very great benefit (tangible or intangible) out of buying a pencil a gallon of gas or a computer generally pay the same price as those for whom the benefit is very slim; and there is no limit to that benefit.<p>This is mostly beside your point I know. I just thought it was a nice idea worth sharing.

Which for me suggests that at some level this isn&#x27;t completely an artifact. If the algorithms developed are so closely modeled on human perception are susceptible to this sort of thing humans probably are too. Perhaps that explains reports of people seeing things in the electronic &#x27;snow&#x27; pattern of a disconnected TV?

0,This is quite interesting. I lived in Okinawa for several years and remember how loathe they were to associate themselves with the Japanese Mainland &quot;Honshu&quot; - even calling themselves &quot;Okinawan&quot; and not Japanese with adamant fervor. A lot of that relates to World War II era atrocities committed on the island but regardless I think Okinawans see themselves as largely very different from the mainland Japanese even though they are citizens of the same country. That would be yet another distinction that I think this article sort of missed as it only referenced differences between far north and the rest of Japan.<p>Having lived in both mainland and Okinawa the cultures are rather starkly different as well - Okinawa with a pretty typical more laid back island culture and mainland with a bustling busy one. In this regard Japan isn&#x27;t as homogeneous - both culturally and genetically - as the article would have you believe if the covered area were to include Japan&#x27;s southernmost islands.

0,This sounds like Engineering but be aware that in mechanical engineering the requirements are well-defined for materials and load. Consider the famous bridge resonance problem and you will see why wind resonance is now a required subject for structural engineering.<p>ME has an advantage over CSE in this regard because in CS the requirements are usually very poorly stated. About the best and most rigorous requirements you get are from mathematicans but most devs and managers now certainly view that as wasting resources.<p>To make not to fine a point of this I always like to turn to Alan Kay&#x27;s comparison: TCP&#x2F;IP vs the web. When was the last time any human technology like TCP&#x2F;IP scaled so well and so invisibly it&#x27;s like air we breathe without even thinking about it. The web in contrast was the work of rank amateurs.<p>Alas mathematics is really the &quot;good enough&quot; standard we in CS should strive for just like physics is the &quot;good enough&quot; standard behind ME and EE. Unfortunately as CS opened to the mainstream I think a deep fear of mathematics led us to view this as &quot;over engineering&quot; even when it wasn&#x27;t. The results are that the majority of the web is woefully <i>under</i>engineered requiring far more money and time for inferior products.<p>We <i>know</i> they are inferior because even the simplest gui application has more consistency than a web variation of it. And that&#x27;s what marketing constantly compares things too when they can&#x27;t understand why the web sucks as much as it does.<p>&quot;Good Enough&quot;? Please! For the last 20 years we haven&#x27;t even come <i>close</i>!

0,The best networking events are events where you actually build and work with a diverse set of strangers.When you work intensely with strangers you really get to know them.I have been organizing open creative events mixing devs designers of all kinds artists… since 2010 and I have seen several teams taking shape out of these events people joining existing teams they wouldn&#x27;t have known of (outside their professional field) and new collaboration forming.(As an organizer I myself met many friends and collaborators during these events).So my advice would be to go to creative events (sprints hackathon weekends *mix jams) that gather a diverse crowd and are designed so teams are actually mixed.My second advice: organize creative events yourself maybe around your product but in all case around your interests. Build the great and interesting professional community you want to be a part of.

0,I&#x27;ve used Flux now on a few toy microprojects and I found that while Flux&#x27;s unidirectional data flow is initially appealing (and I naturally tend to write unidirectional code for very complex UIs in past apps)it makes the simple cases much more tedious and error prone.<p>For example given the simplest case of a Flux store handling events from a single ajax call I find I have to write code like this:<p><pre><code>  onLoad() {    this.loading = true;    this.errorMsg = null;    this.data = null;    this.condition1 = null;    this.condition2 = null;    this.something = null;  }  onSuccess(data) {    this.loading = false;    this.errorMsg = null;    this.data = data;    this.condition1 = data.blah === &#x27;Hello&#x27;;    this.condition2 = data.blah2 === &#x27;World&#x27;;    this.something = data.something;  }  onFailure(errorMsg) {    this.loading = false;    this.errorMsg = errorMsg;    this.data = null;    this.condition1 = null;    this.condition2 = null;    this.something = null;  }</code></pre>If for some reason I was feeling crazy and I wanted the store to handle a second Ajax call the store code becomes much more cumbersome so I avoid this.<p>Even with some of the slicker Flux implementations I still have tons more boilerplate than a traditional MVC app which for the simple UIs makes the code more difficult to reason about. For example I find that in my store I frequently forget to &quot;reset&quot; some property thus making the state &quot;invalid&quot;. I&#x27;ve come up with this type of pattern but it just feels... odd:<p><pre><code>  resetInitialState() {    this.loading = false;    this.errorMsg = null;    this.data = null;    this.condition1 = null;    this.condition2 = null;    this.something = null;  }  onFailure(errorMsg) {    this.resetInitialState();    this.errorMsg = errorMsg;  }</code></pre>

0,Yeah you hit the nail on the head.<p>Right now it&#x27;s Orwellian and sophisticated-- if they have Amazon&#x27;s level of data crunching and prediction ability they might be able to predict certain things about you and on average be more right than wrong.<p>Wait until they have 20 more years of data on you and 20 more years of advancing the quality of their algorithms and machine intelligences. You will be owned and your buttons will be pushed as necessary to maintain what has already been built.
0,They don&#x27;t however involve everyone. The standup does. That&#x27;s key. If person A needs to talk to person B about an issue and it&#x27;s done in standup it wastes person C D etc&#x27;s time even though they don&#x27;t need to be involved. Doing it with just the required people is obviously required anyway and the problem a lot of people doing agile have is they end up wasting everyone&#x27;s time by bringing it up during standup.

0,I can&#x27;t speak for OP but my interest is in signal processing.  DSP and FPGAs are a great match and with the boom in software defined radio having reconfigurable DSP capabilities is extremely useful.<p>For example if 802.11b devices had been built using FPGAs an upgrade to 802.11g could have been an OTA update.  Or a new Bluetooth variant emerges (e.g. BLE) and support could be added to computers and phones overnight.<p>For these applications it&#x27;s useful to think of an FPGA as a chip that you can patch upgrade or reconfigure for new applications.  However looking at it from another angle we can think of it as software that isn&#x27;t limited by the CPU architecture.<p>This second category opens up the possibility of crypto algorithms that don&#x27;t suffer from the timing attacks that they do on the CPU.  Or a video codec that can be designed without having to worry about which extensions the CPU supports.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are much better examples and some of these are bad ideas that would work better on a CPU but hopefully that gives you some ideas.

As these have changed over the years and as I have failed to see convincing evidence in the medical literature I have concluded that people have a strong urge to believe that doing something mildly unpleasant (not eating something delicious) now can somehow prevent much worse things in the future. Its the same mechanism and magical thinking that inspired our ancestors to sacrifice goats to appease the gods and assure a great harvest. Wrapping the explanation in scientific jargon is just the latest iteration of a priest in shiny robes.

"",First C# 7 Design Meeting Notes
0,The US system of authenticating the transaction vs the card&#x2F;user seems to work pretty well. The US rapidly adopted online commerce and payment. Consumers overall have nothing to worry about. Since the merchants and banks are responsible for fraud on credit cards they seem to be a bit more on to of things.<p>N=1 but with Wells Fargo my credit card gets blocked now and then due to suspected fraud. Once it was due to a cloned card being used. Bit of an annoyance getting a new card (they&#x27;re no Amex who&#x27;d always overnight me a card no matter where I was) but otherwise I had zero financial worry. Compare to my debit card. Not one have I even revived a warning about it let alone a block. Even when I gave it to someone to use and take cash out on in another country.<p>EU and others seem to be rushing to implement strong auth but as a consumer screw that. Use machine learning and law enforcement to deal with it and let my experiences be unencumbered. Spending 2 minutes to authorize merchants seems like a large annoyance.

0,I feel like there is some background context people are ignoring in replying to your comment. There are studies showing that men project the characteristics of their wives onto their women colleagues.[1] Combine that with the fact that until recently the expectation was that even women who worked would drop out once they got married because their ambition should be in the home and their husband&#x27;s career ambition is more important. That&#x27;s the background against which a reasonable woman would judge Mr. Lane&#x27;s story.<p>If my wife&#x27;s boss had told her this story she&#x27;d have come home with exactly the impression Ms. Pao did. Indeed when we were in grad school something very similar happened. She went to a career counselor to talk about job searching and she remarked that &quot;oh at least your boyfriend (me) has a good job lined up.&quot; As someone in a relative position of power there is little more you can do to make an ambitious woman feel like shit than remind her that society values her husband&#x2F;boyfriend&#x27;s ambition much more highly than hers.<p>[1] This may be true for both genders.

0,But what x86 can <i>express</i> hasn&#x27;t changed; just how it performs.<p>An abstraction never includes the details of execution; abstraction is that separation itself! A piece of 80386 code running on an 80386 is no more or less abstract than the same piece of code on a Core i7. They agree in their external effects like what inputs are loaded from memory and what result is written.<p>The fact that EAX is renamed to different internal registers or whatever isn&#x27;t really &quot;high level&quot;: not &quot;high level&quot; in any way that helps the programmer express something. It just changes the performance.<p>It&#x27;s not high level the way that say &quot;reduce + list&quot; is higher level relative to &quot;for (total = 0; i = 0; i &lt; list.length(); i++) {total += list[i];}&quot;<p>(Exceptions are situations where programs do certain things; e.g. self-modifying code needs to tackle instruction caches on one implementation but not another. That&#x27;s where the abstraction &quot;leaks&quot;.)

Because you&#x27;ve become reasonably influential (and certainly for good reason mongrel learn the hard way etc) and because of your influence someone might say hey if I&#x27;m a good programmer it might be reasonable to have a short fuse with people and tell them to go fuck themselves because Zed Shaw does. And I want to use this space to say hey I hope we can be nicer to each other. That&#x27;s it. I really don&#x27;t want it to be about anyone in particular I just hope since programmers work with each other and write about each other&#x27;s work on the internet we can be considerate and try to be nice to each other even when we&#x27;re being critical.

0,Germany is not &quot;under the thumb&quot; of the U.S as much as you seem to think. Just look at Ukraine or all the anti Google action that reeks of protectionism. There are simply too many rational arguments against starting a trade war over NSA rigged electronics.<p>Neither Germany nor Europe as a whole makes enough electronics equipment to replace everything that may have been rigged by the NSA or other nations&#x27; spy agencies. The NSA does not restrict itself to equipment clearly marked as &quot;made in USA&quot; either.<p>We cannot solve this problem by rolling back globalisation and division of labor aiming for national self-sufficiency.

0,I won&#x27;t be able to use them in portable code anytime soon but the new feature here that most interests me is __builtin_add_overflow __builtin_sub_overflow and __builtin_mul_overflow<p>&quot;These builtins have two integral arguments (which don&#x27;t need to have the same type) the arguments are extended to infinite precision signed type + - or * is performed on those and the result is stored in an integer variable pointed to by the last argument. If the stored value is equal to the infinite precision result the built-in functions return false otherwise true. The type of the integer variable that will hold the result can be different from the types of the first two arguments.&quot;<p>Handling all possible integer overflow with plain C is annoyingly tricky and for some critical paths in-efficient. These built-ins can often do a conditional jump based on the overflow bit in the flags register.

0,I disagree I think the hard skills for being a successful software developer are picked up by honing your craft daily working on the same project. Hackathons are too contrived since the goal is to have a finished product in 24 ~ 48 hours. Every time I have done one I throw away all the &quot;Danger Bad practice&quot; signals from my sub conscience and work towards finishing the product&#x2F;idea. Things that are important like maintainability (even if your hack is successful and get investor funding you want to re-write it properly) coupling testing documentation API Memory profiling Logging performance optimizations design patterns are thrown out the window to get that idyllic prototype out. Even working as a team there is very little you gain from spending 48 hours with (mostly unknown) individuals than it is for your peers in a job where you actually have a favor economy.<p>And I don&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t any value on hack-a-thons. I think you&#x27;re right on dealing with deadline pressures and the ability of working yourself out of a problem in a pinch are valuable skills. I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s where the &quot;hard&quot; skills needed to become a successful software developer are learned.

0,Mike&#x27;s responses could have been better but in the correspondence I see no guarantee that the files will be presented in order or with the same file names or in an otherwise empty directory.<p>That sounds close to cheating but I think it&#x27;s exactly in the spirit of both the original challenge by Mike and the response by Patrick.  After all the original challenge didn&#x27;t mention multiple files (so it&#x27;s not surprising that this limitation isn&#x27;t mentioned) and the subsequent alteration to the rules was initiated by Patrick who intentionally tried to inject a loophole but failed to specify the need to keep the files in order.  His rules; he should have to live by them.<p>Also I suspect that if Patrick had mentioned the need to leave the file names unaltered or in order there&#x27;s a good chance that Mike would have smelled a rat.  After all it is precisely in that side-channel where the information gain is to be had.

0,<i>Also neither here nor there but engineers are expensive and gigabytes are cheap. There exist many circumstances in which the architecture which requires 12 GB of RAM is a defensible engineering tradeoff versus the one which takes 5 MB.</i><p>This is a vital point — everybody wants to shoot for lovely elegant systems that use minimal resources. But resources are astoundingly cheap; we&#x27;ve got a bunch of servers with 128GB of RAM and you can get these for around £100 a month each. That&#x27;s less than two hours of developer time. If using Ruby in place of another language saves you that much time—or even just makes you a little happier—it&#x27;s probably worth it.

If you could write a good business plan with all the right keywords you could raise an early round even if you were a total sociopath with no clue what you were doing.<p>That&#x27;s not to suggest there was anything actually wrong with that. People hadn&#x27;t invested in SaaS businesses before because they didn&#x27;t exist. No one really knew what was necessary for success. The personality of the founder or their ability to <i>sell</i> wasn&#x27;t considered important. People thought that &quot;Build it they will come&quot; was a viable route to market. The shift to investing in companies that have a good culture driven by interesting exciting founders is something that investors learned relatively slowly.

The first time you come across something that seems amazing it&#x27;s easy to make the leap from &quot;amazing&quot; to &quot;perfect&quot; and become a zealot about it.<p>Then you live with the amazing thing for a while and discover that it actually has flaws that weren&#x27;t obvious at first glance. Then you go through this cycle a few times and realize that <i>everything</i> has flaws and that the art is learning how to identify the things whose flaws impact what you want to do the least rather than being able to find the One Perfect Thing that solves every problem cleanly. And you come to value the tools that tell you their flaws and limitations up front over those that try to hide them behind blustery assertions of perfection.<p>But by the time you realize all that stuff you&#x27;re not young anymore :-D

0,I agree with your argument. Basic income will never work in our society if we are giving it out in the form of spendable money. Basic income in the form of a free amount of utilities provided by the government such as X amount of water and electricity every month I think could work in our capitalist society. Even &#x27;universal&#x27; healthcare falls prey to the same flaws as the $1000&#x2F;month since the quality of the free healthcare will be reduced and the wait times will increase. The best doctors will continue to have private practices that will charge rates that only the richest can afford. As long as capitalism is an integral part of our society I do not foresee basic income being a good solution to any of our social issues.

There are interfaces for everyyyyything.<p>So many of the UI components are unnecessarily internal which can be a pain in the butt if you want to do something just slightly different than default (you obviously can&#x27;t inherit form an interface so you end up copying the code). A lot of the cruft is probably from trying to make Java work but when I read through the code I find myself wondering why it was implemented the way it was implemented and the only explanation I&#x27;ve been able to come up with is the one described in this post.

It&#x27;s a common phrase used in e.g. statutes as a term of art and usually taken as narrower than a phrase like &quot;expresses a view&quot;. However it would almost certainly still include USPTO administrative challenges (e.g. challenging a patent by demonstrating prior art) which is still a big problem.

0,<i>&quot;The necessity of this functionality can be seen by the fact the Go stdlib can ACTUALLY DO THIS for the built-in functions but no facility is provided to do the same for user code.&quot;</i><p>Right. Go has generic types.  Channels and maps are generic types. It just doesn&#x27;t have user defined generics. This is a lack.<p>Getting around this is creating a new level of cruft on top of Go. &quot;Generate&quot; and reflection are being used to work around the lack of generics.  It&#x27;s going to be tempting to use &quot;generate&quot; to invoke a macro language.  That may not end well.

0,These tend to be the aggregate flow of pervasive sensor networks i.e. millions of machines generating this data autonomously. Collected personal location data alone is 6-10 PB&#x2F;day globally most of which is currently discarded because few people can handle it. Some are just incredibly high bandwidth platforms which are more common in industrial and sensor settings. There are more than a couple operational environments today generating <i>billions</i> of records every second that must be stored (not summarized).<p>Some of the sexier petabyte-per-day sources include mobile phone telemetry vehicle telemetry and countless remote-sensing networks and platforms (of which there are far more than most people imagine). A petabyte per day is not that much data per entity there are a lot of entities and you can support this data rate in a single rack of commodity hardware.<p>A more typical generic IoT application at a large company is 1-100 TB&#x2F;day but that is quickly creeping upward as it becomes more cost effective to deploy sensors and store&#x2F;analyze the data. And more often than not they need to store weeks or months of that data so the overall data set size is still quite large.
0,That should be pretty easy with parse transforms here is an example for embedding JSON:<p><a href="https://github.com/happi/json-transform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;happi&#x2F;json-transform</a><p>As another comment suggests (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9215580" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9215580</a>) this would allow you to keep everything as a data structure until the last minute.<p>In regards to business logic I think you just need to be strict when writing your application with the idea of what a &#x27;view&#x27; is. Although React may seem like you are violating separation of concerns in reality view logic and templates are already tightly coupled.

You won&#x27;t get a seat though so that&#x27;s 40 minute standing packed in like cattle on a train service that&#x27;s oftenlate.<p>Of course network rail the line operator kicks back money for lateness but the strange rules of your franchise like paying out only on overall lateness and not considering a train that&#x27;s too full for you to get on as late means they keep 90% of that back for themselves.<p>For most folks that&#x27;s only part one of your commute because few of us actually work where we get into the city.  Typically this means getting on the underground for another 30 minutes this time cattle is being a bit polite.<p>* Actually the £4000 is what I would pay if I paid for a yearly ticket.  Since I don&#x27;t always work in London I get month tickets.  These cost £400 a month.

0,Way back in 1998 I worked at the shipping dock of a distribution warehouse on the 2nd shift.  I was the only guy there most days.<p>My job was to stack all the boxes for a particular store on the pallet bound for that store.  When the stack was tall enough I wrapped the pallet in plastic and wrote the store number on the plastic.<p>At that point there was a QA check to ensure that the number on the plastic matched the number on the boxes.  Since I was the only guy in shipping during that shift guess what happened?<p>Yes you&#x27;re right.  I had to do the QA check on my own work immediately after doing it somewhere between 4 pm and midnight.  The company is very lucky I only ever screwed that up once during the entire summer.  That taught me a valuable lesson for the entire rest of my life:<p>Always separate the QA from the work in a meaningful way.<p>In pair programming as long as one person is actively working and the other verifying that works tolerably well but if those roles start to blur you&#x27;re asking for trouble.  And the longer the pair works the more likely that is to happen.  The two pairs of eyeballs become less like a front view plus side view and more like a stereoscopic image from nearly the same angle.<p>You&#x27;re also setting up a mutually assured snitching situation where both people in the pair want to declare that they are both burned for the day and need a slack break but neither can be the one to call it.  If you&#x27;re inclined to try pairing on your team I&#x27;d recommend no more than three consecutive hours in a pair followed by at least one hour of less intensive individual work.  While I have been able to stay in hyperfocus for much longer than that individually there&#x27;s no way I could with another person in the room--probably not without the assistance of a research psychologist anyway.

It will spin freely and not put any pressure on the cylinder during storage. Then you can just rest it on top of the filter cap in a small dish and drop the accessories in the top. Of course you can argue this adds unnecessary stress by doubling the number of plunges but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.

0,Google has always had issues with legitimate e-mail the spambox but then again I have yet to see a spam filter with no false positives. Google just errors a lot more on the side of classifying email as spam compared to most email services (more false positives but less spam in the inbox). What makes this even more annoying is that they hide the spam folder so that users don&#x27;t even know that it exists anymore. I always have to give directions where to find it and invariably get reactions like &quot;Oh I didn&#x27;t know GMail had a spam box!&quot; or &quot;Ah thanks I would never have found that.&quot;<p>I did consider setting up a route in my mailserver to GMail using my Google account credentials for their SMTP server but then decided they should better get their own shit straight. It wouldn&#x27;t scale to do this for everyone.

0,That&#x27;s all well and good <i>from the consumers point of view</i>. It doesn&#x27;t help people who are spending their working hours at a place that cannot support them. It&#x27;s not about doing things less efficiently so your &#x27;building with shovels&#x27; example is facile. The point is that companies alone cannot be entrusted with the welfare of their employees - this is why minimum wage and works rights &#x2F; entitlements exist in the first place. The concern is that these companies are using loopholes to skirt the laws to the detriment of <i>citizens</i>.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d agree that citizens rights should trump those of consumers who want cheap stuff.

Especially given that a recruiter who would place someone at Stripe is probably taking home $20-40k on a placement.<p>Also what are the plans outside of security related (if any)?

It doesn&#x27;t look an order of magnitude smaller to me.<p>As for where the money comes from doesn&#x27;t that just fall out of supply and demand? As demand for electricity increases prices will go up funding the infrastructure improvements needed to accommodate the increased demand.<p>The solution may not even lie in the grid. Batteries can solve the grid problem as well as the battery problem. Give every electric car customer enough solar to cover his charging needs and a fixed storage installation to keep the power for when the car comes home and the grid won&#x27;t even know the cars are there.<p>I&#x27;m sure this will all be wonderfully challenging for those involved but it doesn&#x27;t look like something to worry about from the outside.

What nuance of your stated position did I mistake? In what way do you make a profit and enrich yourself without it coming at the expense of another? Bear in mind that trading something of yours for money from someone else is very literally a trade taking place at their expense - they are spending money.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s entirely possible for landlords to raise rents in such a way that continues to cover their costs continues to provide a tidy profit margin but does not displace tenants.<p>Not when prop 13 caps are generally higher than rent control caps. Over time a property-owner <i>will</i> lose ground and their margin will shrink as their costs increase faster than their incomes.<p>In practice this manifests as landlords deciding not to invest in the upkeep and maintenance so they can preserve their profit margins.

A number of former co-workers work there [1] however and if they&#x27;re any indicator of the caliber of people the company employs then they&#x27;re probably pretty solid.<p>They&#x27;re selling a (presumably somewhat reliable) minimum level of quality in the courses they put up so that people who have better things to do than perform comparative analyses of the free offerings out there [2] can get on with the thing they wanted to do in the first place: <i>learn the material they&#x27;re interested in learning</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a particularly terrible business model at all — especially if you can also flip it for $1.5b.<p>[1] Congrats to them and I hope their options agreement included accelerated vestiture upon acquisition!<p>[2] A thing that might be rather difficult given their desire to learn about the subject in the first place.

The sort of comparison you make reminds of the flawed concept of &quot;dog years&quot;: there are no linear relations here. Anyway the most troublesome symptom of a &quot;dummy&quot; foal is that it doesn&#x27;t nurse properly. I haven&#x27;t heard that about autistic children.

0,Several ES6 features very much resemble the few ways coffeescript syntax differs from older versions of ecmascript. Arrow functions destructured assignment string templates.<p>In context we were commenting on this:<p><pre><code>    .attr(&#x27;transform&#x27; d =&gt; `translate(${d.x + 1} 0)`)</code></pre>which looks pretty similar to the coffeescript counterpart:<p><pre><code>    .attr &#x27;transform&#x27; (d) -&gt; &quot;translate(#{d.x + 1} 0)&quot;</code></pre>Five subtle differences but it shows how the things that are new&#x2F;different about ES6 are more similar to typescript and coffeescript than ES5.

My rationale is that it&#x27;s very difficult to fight organizational inertia from the bottom so instead find an organization that&#x27;s moving in the direction you want your career to move in.<p>The market is in our favor right now and my suggestion would be to take advantage of that to build up some &#x27;career capital&#x27; (and hopefully some cash money capital) to see you through whatever&#x27;s coming next.<p>BTW &#x27;career capital&#x27; is a phrase I lifted from Cal Newport&#x27;s &quot;So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You&quot; which was an interesting read regarding passion and career development. I&#x27;d recommend it it&#x27;s pretty light reading.

0,WP is a perfectly fine tool for many scenarios. There&#x27;s something nice about having a blogging platform that&#x27;s easy to install and use. The problem I see if that this blogging platform gets shoe-horned into a CMS-like role with half-assed extensions and modifications many of which are written by amateurs running a freemium-style model and often have little to no community source code review.  I find popular extensions are okay its just when you start looking at more obscure stuff because now your WP needs to be Drupal-light and SugarCRM-like that you run into trouble.  WP is pretty much a victim of its own success.  Lots of people have made sure the Wrong Way to do things is easy in the WP ecosystem and that hurts the core product.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised to see a site that gets as much traffic as Wired using WP. I could see Drupal taking this role. Drupal of course is not without its faults. I&#x27;ve been part of a few Drupal roll-outs and have done development on it and my god there&#x27;s an ugly learning curve here.  If money is an issue you can get a decent WP dev a lot less a Drupal shop would charge you.  I imagine Wired being a print magazine in the age of dying print probably didn&#x27;t have a big budget.<p>Personally I&#x27;d love to see something as solid as Drupal but with the ease of WP. Maybe this middle ground is impossible but it would be nice to whip up a Drupal instance and have certain roles or templates ready to go like WP does.  Instead stock Drupal is pretty much nothing out of the box and the dollars&#x2F;time involved to make it something usable and finished can be significant.<p>&gt;an average of four cookies for every visit (which messes with some caching attempts)<p>That&#x27;s a trivial fix in Varnish. I run Varnish in front of WP for my own personal blog.<p>&gt; I can tell just from your headers that you&#x27;re running on Apache 2.4.6 on PHP 5.6.6 and using Varnish 4<p>If that&#x27;s the worst sin they&#x27;ve committed then I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re doing pretty well.  Securing WP isn&#x27;t that tough.  I find most LAMP apps are security nightmares and WP is just the posterboy for this and because of its popularity gets all the attention. If you&#x27;re not running an IDS&#x2F;IPS and locking down WP securing permissions on your server running SELinux etc then you&#x27;re just asking for trouble.<p>I used to feel pretty confident about Drupal from a security POV until SA-2014-003.  Considering how bad that was it scared me a bit and makes me wonder why no one can make a CMS without major security issues in this day and age. I need to do the same amount of locking down with Drupal as I do WP. From a server admin role there&#x27;s not much difference between the two. I still need to do all that security stuff and admins who say &quot;Oh Drupal is secure I dont need to do that stuff&quot; are the ones who are going to continue to get burned.

I wasn&#x27;t even trying to &quot;compare&quot; this Asus to any Apple offerings but rather just saying if you want a Windows machine with the portability of the new Macbook but without some of the compromises this seems like a good choice.<p>Also my current laptop is a 2015 Macbook Pro so your anti-Apple bias argument is out of place too.

0,Indeed the published Le Monde statement was in response to Faurisson. I don&#x27;t see how this is important. What&#x27;s important is the attitude of the historians and academics that made that statement. The statement is very clear in that it seeks to supress certain questions from being asked. I don&#x27;t understand your accusation that the quote is &quot;out of context&quot;. The context is that someone questioned something and 34 scholars published a statement saying that they as scholars think that question should not be raised.<p>I have no problem sourcing the statements I made here. For the BBC interview see here (timestamp: 3:33): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF4GFGMNm3g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JF4GFGMNm3g</a> which I quote below:<p>David: &quot;The judge says &#x27;I always assumed that there was the evidence that Auschwitz had gas chambers I was surprised to find that there wasn&#x27;t until this case came along&quot;<p>Tim: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t documentary evidence is what he said he doesn&#x27;t say there wasn&#x27;t any evidence he said there wasn&#x27;t documentary evidence&quot;<p>David: &quot;There were eyewitnesses and he relies on half a dozen eyewitnesses&quot;<p>The transcripts for the trial are available for you to investigate for yourself but the BBC acknowledging in public there&#x27;s no documentary evidence for it and quoting from the trial itself should be enough for you to investigate for yourself from now on and should be convincing enough.<p>I do not believe in the racial conspiracy theories you&#x27;re trying to accuse me of. Nor do I need to. I do not need to believe in any conspiracy theory in order to be interested in the facts about WW2 and in order to understand that in the reality we live in there is no documentary evidence for an event that is heavily glorified and propagandized in the mainstream education system and media.

This isn&#x27;t of course &quot;starting a company&quot; or even in most cases developing a product. Instead it&#x27;s about coming up with an intriguing idea that since you&#x27;re just at the starting line yourself can be jumped on and stolen by whoever else is there and has more startup capital than you do.

Why should wider society pay to insure Uber drivers just to make Uber more profitable?

It assumes no dilution from exiting... which in the real world never happens.<p>You can actually see how much money FB&#x27;s top shareholders were worth at their IPO.

0,* Strength training: I focus on building strength not size (I&#x27;m already a pretty big guy 6&#x27; 1&quot; 220lb).  Workout 4 times&#x2F;wk 5 sets&#x2F;5 reps using a  moderately heavy weight I could lift 8-10 times (stopping at 5).<p>* Cardio: I don&#x27;t do as much cardio as I used to due to a knee injury but I recently bought a standing desk and have been experimenting with cycling on a spinning bike for .5 - 1hr&#x2F;day on the bike.<p>* Diet: I used to eat like shit but changed by diet in January.  Now I east sushi for breakfast and dinner ~5 times&#x2F;wk and typically eat a black bean&#x2F;chicken burrito for lunch.  I get the sushi at my local supermarket so it&#x27;s only ~$8&#x2F;meal.  Doing zero cardio (just strength training) I lost 20b in the first 2.5 months.  I&#x27;ve since leveled off since I&#x27;m less strict but keeping the weight off feels effortless since it was more of a lifestyle change than a diet.<p>* Sleep: I typically don&#x27;t set an alarm unless my wife needs it but when I do we aim for 8 hours.  Sleep is crucial.<p>* Personal relationships: They&#x27;re important.  I used to not pay much attention to them (even my marriage) since I&#x27;m a solitary creature but I try harder now.  I&#x27;m even trying to make friends rather than just having acquaintances.  Currently the only people I talk to regularly are my mom and my wife my business partners are a distant third.<p>* Play: I spent the last few years working every minute.  Now I play a video game every now and then.  It let&#x27;s me &quot;relax&quot; while still feeling like I&#x27;m accomplishing something.  I don&#x27;t yet know how important this is and I may stop.  Relaxing isn&#x27;t in my DNA it makes me anxious and feels very uncomfortable.  The closest thing I can do to relaxing is hanging out with my wife and having an interesting conversation.<p>* Drink water: Aside from the occasional Diet Coke I only drink water.  I don&#x27;t drink coffee tea or alcohol but I never have so this isn&#x27;t a change.  I used to drink flavored drinks like Crystal Light but switched back to water.

0,&gt; Are you sure that you&#x27;d be able to do that? supervised education helps you to pace yourself focus on what is important and to keep motivated over the long run. The actual content is maybe the least important.<p>I&#x27;m 100% sure. The motivation is all there. Why would I be in this class if I had to be coaxed into learning about it?<p>I think I can learn more in one long sitting than piecing away at any given topic. That&#x27;s my personal experience. Instead I get distracted taking 5 courses at once and learn comparatively little.<p>&gt; Besides going through lex and yacc sources sounds like a huge waste of time for someone who wants to learn about compilation. There may be some value in this but it should be last on your priority list.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but no. Compared to what we&#x27;re actually doing it&#x27;s far far far better.<p>What am I going to come away with from the class? I guess I&#x27;ll be a rock star interviewer but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be much else.<p>Implementing something using only common tools and doing it without any code from the instructor would certainly result in more skills moving forward.

You don&#x27;t know anything about high school math contests or the motivations of students that do them or anything about that world at all and amid irrelevant stories about your life you&#x27;re just pretending that you do.<p>To clarify: I think you don&#x27;t know what kinds of problems they ask what their contest format is like what students learn and practice when preparing for them how it affects students&#x27; interest in research mathematics and how it develops their abilities there. Why do I think that? Because instead of talking about the USAMO or ARML or the NSA&#x27;s mail-in contest or anything <i>specific</i> about whether these contests actually harm or distract students&#x27; attention from what you think they should be doing instead of rebutting the well-known &quot;calculus trap&quot; opinion or showing that you have any awareness of it instead of showing knowledge of what students do to prepare for these contests you&#x27;ve talked in abstractions and there is no glue tying the words you are saying to objective reality.

0,Too bad the post was flagged.<p>My intention was to spark a discussion on the high-level ideas but it seems that many are more interested in the implementation. That&#x27;s fair. The challenge in this case is that &quot;what it is&quot; matters less than &quot;where it&#x27;s going&quot; or &quot;why it exists&quot;.<p>In a nutshell: First choose a thread of action - narrow your view to one set of things you already do. Then when you act you record that you took that action. Add more threads-of-action as you wish organize as needed. That&#x27;s the beginning of Benome. This pattern remains throughout as the fundamental.<p>This simple pattern allows Benome to become an interactive visualization that combines your past behaviour with probabilities for you future behaviour. A very simple example is that if your chosen thread of action was when you buy tomatoes and then you choose to share that thread with someone who sells tomatoes they&#x27;d know when you were ready to buy. But that same pattern can be used for many more applications than simple commerce. You can leverage a detailed awareness of your own behaviour into many personal advancements.

If so then the trips could be worth encouraging as a societal norm not for the good that they do directly but for the impact that they have on later donations. If the trips don&#x27;t have much of an impact then it would be better to discourage people from doing this and societally encourage donations instead.

They knew what the shortcomings of theory were and how you had to mold the theoretical to match the practical.<p>One example in a neuro class talking about EEGs a lecturer was saying that the solution between electrodes didn&#x27;t have to be anything special (usually it&#x27;s a medical supply) and that even mayonnaise would do he&#x27;d used it once. Fast forward a few years and one of my fellow students was working in a lab and they ran out of goo. She says she went down and bought a jar of mayonnaise and it worked fine - and in the setting of a medical lab it even smells a bit medicinal.

When something is eaten it&#x27;s digested into something unrecognizable and then discarded. That&#x27;s a terrible analogy for what software is doing to the world and in this case to companies.<p>For unlucky people&#x2F;companies&#x2F;industries software is simply replacing it. You could perhaps more accurately say that software is outmoding those things. &quot;Eating their lunch&quot; maybe but not eating them.<p>For lucky people&#x2F;companies&#x2F;industries software is a lubricating or accelerating factor. It&#x27;s not eating them either.

0,Yeah exactly. I feel like the author is missing the point of the optimizer. It&#x27;s not something that attempts to fix bad code it just expresses the programmers intent  efficiently.  For example if I have a common subexpression I would <i>expect</i> the compiler to notice it and take care of it automatically instead of me having to tediously code it explicitly to do the right thing. Given how large open source libraries are today all of those little inefficiencies add up (in size and space) if we just let the compiler be stupid.<p>But the easiest counterargument is to just to tell someone to compile their program at -O0 (which I&#x27;ve done inadvertently on an number of occasions). The program is noticeably bigger and slower.

0,(Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a white male) Statistics overwhelmingly document sexual violence (and all violence by the way) as male behavior and historical record shows that the ideological and individual defenses of it is also overwhelmingly male. Your sentence is non-sequitur in this context.
0,Well MCMC is pretty close to brute force so it&#x27;s never going to be very fast.<p>But the diagnostic tools are really quite good these days – tools like Stan and PyMC make it easy to see diagnostic plots that allow you to check for convergence and such. Additionally more and more fine-tuning is happening automatically like setting the right jump sizes and a plausible initial value for the random walk.<p>Note that traditional statistics like regression requires similar diagnostic steps: qqplots to check for the normality of your data the Levene test for heteroskedasticity and so on. They often get ignored but they&#x27;re generally not hard to teach or learn.<p>We&#x27;re really not that far from having this stuff be usable by the broader public. Maybe not &quot;build any model you like and it will just work out of the box&quot; but definitely as a replacement for much frequentist statistics. See &quot;Doing Bayesian Data Analysis&quot; by Kruschke for example.

I am able to keep prices low but not low enough to start getting cheap demanding customers (you need to really work on your pricing to snatch mostly wealthy customers that see your price like a discount not cheap and that if anything goes wrong wont give you hard time about it).I don&#x27;t mind if I lose 1 or even 10 customers and I tend to &quot;fire customers&quot; every month or two. That&#x27;s freedom.<p>And just to clarify - I am no a company - I still work a lot and I do the most important jobs myself. I also never blame my employees for delays etc - as employer expects me to deliver not my employees.<p>imo freedom is achievable as a freelancer only if you can fire your customers without going bankrupt and affecting your future finances to much.

0,&gt; Linear-session-typed process calculi are guaranteed deadlock-free and race-free<p>While this  may be true for certain restricted systems this claim is misleading. Session types as invented by K. Honda and refined by numerous others guarantee deadlock and race freedom <i>only within any given session</i>. Session initiation (basically messages to replicated inputs) can deadlock and race in many (most?) session typing systems. The decision <i>not</i> to guarantee the absence of deadlock at session initiation points is what makes session types so simple.<p>It is possible to restrict session types so that they are completely deadlock-free and race-free but -- as far as we know -- that guarantee comes at the heavy price of making the typing system completely inexpressive so you cannot  type many natural forms of concurrent programming. Alternatively you can  give up on simplicity and make  the typing system very complicated (e.g. the system pioneered in &quot;Strong Normalisation in the Pi-Calculus&quot; by Honda et al and its successors). The former is a real problem as witnessed by the continuing inability of the session typing crowd to get a handle on message passing in Erlang.<p>Finding a system that is expressive simple and guarantees deadlock-freedom is a major open research problem (and I suspect infeasible).

0,I&#x27;m quite tired so I might be mistaken here but autorun reminds me of Knockout&#x27;s computed properties.<p><pre><code>  function viewModel() {    this.observable = ko.observable();    this.updateWhenObsChanged = ko.computed(function() {      console.log(this.observable());  &#x2F;&#x2F; logs whenever the observable changes      return this.observable();  &#x2F;&#x2F; see template example below    });  }  ko.applyBindings(viewModel);</code></pre>Any observables used in a computed property are automatically watched. The computed property can contain any JS code; it makes the function inside reactive.<p>Knockout also has a built in templating library where you can do things like: &lt;p data-bind=&quot;text: updateWhenObsChanged&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;<p>It seems like in this library one area that&#x27;s more flexible than KO is that you can create various reactive data sources. However in KO you can essentially do the same thing by updating an observable. For instance you could have this.webSocketResponse = ko.observable() and call it with a new value for every websocket response you give.<p>Now for me the step beyond this is a library like Reactive Extensions (RxJS for Javascript) which instead of having stateful observables gives you async streams of events. For instance say that you have two buttons #1 and #2 and you want to do something when button one is pressed before button two:<p><pre><code>  var buttonOne = $(&#x27;#1&#x27;);  var buttonOneClickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(buttonOne &#x27;click&#x27;);  var buttonTwo = $(&#x27;#2&#x27;);  var buttonTwoClickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(buttonTwo &#x27;click&#x27;);  var lastTwoClicks = buttonOneClickStream    .map(function () { return 1; }) &#x2F;&#x2F; clicking button one produces a 1    .merge(  &#x2F;&#x2F; merge buttonOneClickStream&#x27;s output with the buttonTwoClickStream      buttonTwoClickStream.map(function() { return 2; }) &#x2F;&#x2F; clicking button two produces a 2    )    .bufferWithCount(2); &#x2F;&#x2F; emit an array of two values once we have two values from our merged streams  var firstThenSecond = function (arr) {    return arr[0] === 1 &amp;&amp; arr[1] === 2;  };  var clickedFirstThenSecond = lastTwoClicks      .filter(firstThenSecond);  &#x2F;&#x2F; only emit events that match our filter  var notifyOnSuccess = clickedFirstThenSecond.subscribe(function() {    console.log(&quot;woot&quot;);  });</code></pre>The nice thing about this approach is that you can build up a variety of streams and merge them in a reusable and functional way. While this is possible in KO I find that unless I&#x27;m very disciplined I ended up with a mess of computed properties scattered throughout my app. Since in KO we are using the observer pattern which is stateful this can cause some complexities. But with stateless streams we have a more declaritive and perhaps even &quot;imperative&quot; approach.<p>The step beyond this it to tie these streams into something more advanced than JQuery like virtualdom. I started working on this only to find someone else has already accomplished a lot more than me in <a href="https://github.com/staltz/cycle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;staltz&#x2F;cycle</a>  However I think I might like a template-based approach using something like handlebars.<p>Anyways I&#x27;m quite tired so I might be mistaken in my assesment of this library. But I think anyone interested in reactive programming might like KO RxJS and Cycle. KO&#x27;s worked quite nicely for me despite my complaints about the limitations of stateful observers.<p>Complete example of RxJS: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/bjhyvvjs/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsfiddle.net&#x2F;bjhyvvjs&#x2F;</a><p>How to grok reactive programming: <a href="https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;staltz&#x2F;868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754</a><p>Why React.js isn&#x27;t actually reactive: <a href="http://staltz.com/dont-react/#/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;staltz.com&#x2F;dont-react&#x2F;#&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: Argh I&#x27;m so sorry about the bad code rendering...

What if you took a Coursera online course on Python and he said the same thing?  What if you got a Python Programming Certificate from O&#x27;Reilly and he said &quot;Well any monkey who pays for the training software could do that&quot;?<p>The truth is you will most certainly benefit financially if you put it on your resume and your LinkedIn profile.  I think recruiters and tech-savvy employers would gobble that up.  It definitely shows that you are extremely knowledgeable about the language and can answer almost any question without hesitation.  It <i>also</i> shows that you are articulate and that you are the kind of person who would take the time to teach others and share your knowledge.  These are very valuable traits that are extremely valuable in software companies.<p>People who are saying &quot;It shows you have a lot of free time&quot; are nuts.  Free time for what?  Thinking about software?  Who wouldn&#x27;t love that from a potential job candidate?  I guess it also shows that you have a lot of free time if you&#x27;re going to tech conferences take online courses or go to night school.<p>Not all people will value your badge but I&#x27;m pretty sure you could leverage it to find a new higher-paying job with an open-minded boss who isn&#x27;t going to discredit your accomplishments.<p>Congratulations on your badge!

0,High on volume? What?!<p>You can be out of the gym in 30 minutes or less. It&#x27;s 3 exercises 3 times per week. 15 sets total per gym session (not counting warm-up sets).<p>The whole point is to start with a very low weight (empty bar) and work your way up by adding 2.5lbs to each side every time you go back in. It&#x27;s the fastest linear progression workout for beginners.<p>From my experience Strong Lifts 5x5 is the recommended beginner&#x27;s workout. You need a solid base to start off with. and 5x5 gets you there the quickest because you are doing compound lifts. Biggest gym noob mistake is to go in there and start doing isolation exercises when you are already lacking a base. That causes muscle imbalances which can then result in tendon and joint issues.<p>Edit: Just wanted to add that the 5x5 can transition into 3x5 and then 1x5 as you move up in weight and plateau. This can keep you going until you squat 400-500 pounds and deadlift 500-600.

My son wrote an important program that manages the databases it runs on.&quot; I asked if he was talking about SQLite and he said that yes that was the program. Turned out there were a few other people there who knew about SQLite so we had a bit of a geek out for the rest of the night discussing FOSS SQL mobile development and so on.

0,&gt;  &quot;easy&quot; API&#x27;s generally do it by making a ton of assumptions.<p>Well perhaps a better way of putting it is that &quot;easy&quot; APIs try to model a domain.  Sometimes the API designer just nails it and folks forget eventually take it for granted.  The problem is now &quot;solved&quot;.  For example the Unix userspace filesystem API (open close read write etc.) is pretty damn solid for what it is.  I admit that I took it for granted until I worked at a place where someone who&#x27;d never seen a filesystem API (!!) was tasked with creating one from the ground up.  You can guess how that went.<p>The downside case is where the API&#x27;s model either never cut it in the first place or as @wtallis illuminates above with OpenGL where the model just ages poorly[1].<p>[1] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9194138" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9194138</a>

0,In which case you might want to supply us with a little more detail. Last I looked (it&#x27;s been a while) CAS seemed the most sane choice for something like this for an intranet-ish thing over http(s!) -- if you can&#x27;t just use ssh and ssh certs (obviously very different use cases).<p>Does anyone have any insight to what the state of the art is marrying kerberos ideas and nacl? I found this:<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pieterh/zeromq-security" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;pieterh&#x2F;zeromq-security</a><p>But it is obviously somewhat dated now -- did zeromq+sasl+nacl go anywhere? In what form? I&#x27;d hoped that this would &quot;get sorted&quot; and allow saltstack to leverage something a little more standard (which would alleviate my last doubts about salt -- but my fears might be unfounded -- I&#x27;ve just not seen anything that really addresses the early issues they had with security&#x2F;transport&#x2F;encryption).<p>Anyone using: <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/libcurve" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zeromq&#x2F;libcurve</a> in anger?<p>Finally I can&#x27;t resist posting this soundtrack that I had serendipitously playing in the background as I read the above slidedeck: &quot;Nothin&#x27; - Townes Van Zandt&quot;.

0,&gt; At the end of the day is anyone arguing it was a bad thing that the Americans got to the bomb (and used it) before the Germans<p>The moral justification for the bomb was a concern that Germany was working on a similar project after they stopped exports of uranium[1]. Japan and Russia had little to do with the decision.<p>In fact several people working on the Manhattan project later commented they regretted the decision to develop the bomb especially after hostilities ended in the European Theater abating  the threat of Nazi Germany developing the bomb first.<p>Feynman has commented[2] specifically that his focus on the work had totally blinded him to this change in moral justification. &quot;What I did immorally I would say was not to remember the <i>reason</i> I said I was doing it so that when the reason changed which was that Germany was defeated not the <i>single thought</i> came to my mind at all about that; that that meant now that I had to reconsider why I&#x27;m continuing to do this.&quot;<p>Just because something is possible doesn&#x27;t mean it should be done even if there <i>was</i> a justification in the past.<p>Also the tools that the NSA wields may not be as bloody - with some exceptions[3] - but the cost in terms of the number of people affected already exceeded the losses due to the bomb and will continue to grow in the future. Personal-scale tools that can do their work mostly hidden from public view have very little cost to the attacker. People notice and might get angry about using the bomb while blackmail threats and bribery can continue for years and years before enough people notice. (and small casual racism or sexism can continue for centuries even after people start to think the problem is &quot;fixed&quot;)<p>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_l...</a><p>[2] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgaw9qe7DEE#t=986" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Bgaw9qe7DEE#t=986</a><p>[3] <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/-sp-us-drone-strikes-kill-1147" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;nov&#x2F;24&#x2F;-sp-us-drone-...</a>

The problem is that it allows you to <i>build</i> insane amounts of complexity in a very &quot;free for all&quot; way. No &quot;one sane default way to do it&quot;.<p>The problem is now <i>how complex a language is</i> but <i>how much needless complexity it allows you to build yourself</i>.<p>Go seems great because it doesn&#x27;t easily allow you to build needless complexity.

0,There is a much reduced and heavily edited sequence on quantum mechanics in the ebook. I have not yet read the ebook version and can&#x27;t tell you how they differ but the editor did state upfront that it was one of the sections which changed the most.<p>Regarding the LessWrong&#x2F;OvercomingBias version I must say that you should take the blog posts with a huge gigantic over-sized helping of salt. Speaking as someone who majored in physics because I love the field even though I knew it wouldn&#x27;t help my comp sci career Yudkowsky does not have the necessary background to speak with authority on this topic and it shows. He makes a few outright mistakes and a lot more overly broad statements he ignores many validly competing alternative explanations and as a result the grand philosophical conclusions reached are left unjustified (and as an editorial aside probably bunk IMHO).<p>The important result of analyzing quantum mechanics as a case study in rationality is the valid point that if like most people (and sadly most physics professors) you think quantum mechanics is weird that should be very concerning. Quantum mechanics is <i>real</i>: it very accurately describes reality. If you have a problem with quantum mechanics you have a problem with reality and that&#x27;s about as anti-rationalist as you can get. To improve find out what part of you rejects the reality of quantum mechanics in spite of experimental evidence and censor that.<p>Once you&#x27;ve achieved that step you can skip the rest IMHO.

Why not use &quot;first&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; or &quot;head&quot; and &quot;tail&quot; for CL21 instead?<p>Nothing about programming is intuitive.<p>The problem here is that you&#x27;ve adopted ideas and notions from another language and are bringing that baggage to Common Lisp. If you learned Common Lisp first you might not have this very issue you describe.<p>For historical reasons &quot;car&quot; and &quot;cdr&quot; are the names of special pointers to the elements of a cons cell. There&#x27;s nothing about them that have anything to do with lists. You just happen to be able to construct lists by linking together cons cells. CAR and CDR simply deference the pointers in the cons cell:<p><pre><code>    (atom . atom)</code></pre>Where <i>atom</i> can be a value or a another cons cell. In this visualization it&#x27;s useful to think of CAR as referring to the &quot;atom on the left&quot; and CDR referring to the &quot;atom on the right.&quot; One or both of those atoms could be a cons cell... so there&#x27;s nothing about CAR or CDR that has anything to do with notions of &quot;first&quot; &quot;last&quot; &quot;head&quot; or &quot;tail.&quot;<p>Those are higher-order functions for operating on linked list and are in the Common Lisp specification anyway.<p>Suggesting that Common Lisp should remove them is like saying you should remove pointers from C.

But you can use that &quot;post-branding&quot; that is typical of Mintzberg and I think the author of the blog does a good job.

"",Why Why Functional Programming Matters Matters (2007)
0,On the one hand this is really awesome because by opening ChromeOS up to Android apps it becomes much more useful.<p>The other side of the medal is that this might slow down progress on the open web-platform as developers would rather develop a native android app than put effort to make a web-app.<p>It somehow funny: Recent developments around the web platform (service workers etc) are supposed to make web-apps compete with native apps and even Microsoft is starting to embrace this (web based skype). At the same time now native apps run in the web. It will be interesting how to this will evolve.<p>It also shows why Google developed NaCL and that it doesn&#x27;t really matter that it hasn&#x27;t been adopted by other browsers. Because its main use case is for ChromeOS.
0,&quot;Orwellian&quot; has become one of HN&#x27;s least useful snarl words that now communicates nothing aside from &quot;I disagree with this point of view and consequently the way it is framed.&quot;<p>If you were black you might see it as &quot;Orwellian&quot; when someone claims an admissions policy is non-discriminatory when it results in a class that is 6% black and 29% Asian among U.S. students (this is CMU) while blacks make up 13% of the U.S. population and Asians make up 5.3%.<p>You are trying to cloak your subjective opinion in the veneer of science and objectivity with nonsense about &quot;verifiable and falsifiable&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t work.  In your example - &quot;Republicans feel that they&#x27;re treated poorly by the media&quot; - what would be a falsifiable and verifiable statement?  &quot;Republicans ARE treated poorly by the media?&quot;  How is that or any statement like it falsifiable or verifiable?<p>Likewise in what way are questions of racial fairness verifiable or falsifiable?  If one policy is &quot;race blind&quot; and results in some minorities being seriously under-represented is it fair because of its &quot;race blindness&quot; or unfair because of its outcome?  If another policy takes race into consideration is it unfair because it takes race into consideration in admissions or fair because its outcome results in a proportional representation?<p>It&#x27;s a question of values not a question of science.  Depending on your point of view you are going to see it very differently from someone else.

By my estimation Slack is not too far from being profitable (or able to get that way) with ARR somewhere between $15M - $30M and only 125 employees.<p>With this big war chest Slack could buy or build a few other collaboration tools.  It&#x27;d be great to have a competitor to Google Apps at a similar price point.

If so it&#x27;s a staggering oversight to leave the domain dormant.
0,Yes.<p>Though if the silicon process technology is as good as they claim then scaling that up a little bit (to be on-par with conventional 8-bit micros) won&#x27;t be too bad.  It will be interesting to see if they can maintain the kind of leakage they&#x27;re talking about with a smaller process size.

I would assume it is possible there is a typical structure as the <i>majority</i> of the YC companies are in a similar position at the beginning (i.e. seed funding in the same amount with the anticipation of quickly raising additional funds at the end).  Examples of the exceptions I can think of would be the non-profits that do not have stock and I believe some may come to the table having already raised some funding.

0,It&#x27;s an interesting point since I don&#x27;t know how much other engineering fields are beset with this problem. The article features a photo of a collapsed bridge but obviously its topic is software. Do civil or aerospace engineering firms have the same problem of incompetent coworkers who manage to pass all their interviewing hurdles? It seems hard to imagine -- I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d fake the math on static and dynamic loads without actually knowing what I was doing. Why is software so different lacking basic shared and provable prerequisite skills?

0,You are still trying to restrict the concept of a nation to a narrow definition that suits your needs.  Palestinians have been continuously living in the area for as long as Jews.  But their claim to the land is stronger since they were still living there at the turn of the century while the European and other Jews who emigrated after the establishment of Israel did not.<p>I suggest <i>you</i> look into the history of Palestinians their genetics and history.  For example Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians are  genetically very similar.  Some hypothesize that Palestinians are descendants of Jews who converted to Islam.<p>Regarding the solution to the problem of Jewish people lacking a homeland I don&#x27;t have an easy solution for that.  But at the very least a solution would involve acknowledging the similarities between Zionism and European Nationalism.  You say the Jewish story is incomparable to other situations but I think the parallels I&#x27;ve drawn are sufficient for most people to see that there is some discrepancy between how American liberals approach Israel vs other kinds of ethnic nationalism.

We learn a tool well so we continue to use it in situations where it might not be the best for the job in hand or might be over-engineered for the purpose. Git falls into this use case a lot because once you understand how to use it why not continue to use it even if the project doesn&#x27;t really need distributed version control. It&#x27;s a waste of time to learn a new system.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve never even bothered to learn git. I used to use Perforce at work now I use it for my own projects. It does the job well why switch?

0,Apologies in advance for my lack in eloquence this is off the cuff...<p>I have been thinking this is true of the information services organizations being organized as ITaaS. There is only one help desk and this leads to IT behaving as a monopoly.  As a monopoly there are few incentives to perform better.  In order to preserve the organizations value layers of bureaucracy are added to measure the performance of the organization.  These grow organically but manifest themselves as status reports and status meetings.  Small committees make broad mandates which operation-wise are questionable.   Looking at the CRM this creates chains of approval for resolving tickets forms with 25 fields which contain hundreds of selectable values.<p>The perverse design of enterprise CRM I feel is greatly a product of the monopolistic&#x2F;bureaucratic behavior in a large organization.

I don&#x27;t mind talking about things like nuclear energy or biotech because people are either going to start those companies or not.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to cause founders to start or stop working on specific idea because I say something like &quot;I think enterprise software is great&quot; and they really want to get into YC.  I never used to worry about this but I&#x27;ve since found it happens surprisingly often.<p>The best companies are usually started before any trend is obvious.

(I want to find all sequences that match my 20-mer with an identity score of at least 14&#x2F;20 --- what&#x27;s my well-formed regex for that? There are 38760 different ways to choose 14 of 20 nucleotides.)<p>Plus there&#x27;s the added overhead of having to come up with a well-formed regex to begin with. :)

0,&gt;Which is better: a bright graduate working on making a large web company&#x27;s advertising algorithms slightly more efficient or the same person working for an investment bank on a bond deal that helps a biotech company raise more money for future R&amp;D?<p>That&#x27;s the very definition of a false choice.  We should be pouring more resources into developing new technology itself not just trying to advertise or fund it more efficiently.  Right now small technical innovators are being absolutely starved of capital and it&#x27;s going to have some pretty dire consequences for the US economy in the coming decades.  When is the last time that you saw a successful hardware startup that did something nontrivial (a la Intel)?  The only reason software businesses are doing so well is because they require very little capital.<p>All of the shifting money between hands on Wall Street is sucking the air out of our industries.

0,&gt; Peter Todd suggests that PGP drop encrypted communications as a goal and focus only on identity and authentication.<p>Identity and authentication are the biggest reason that PGP <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> caught on with non-technical users - the web-of-trust is necessary to do distributed identity and authentication properly (under the current model) and the importance of out-of-band verification can be hard to explain. Authentication (as opposed to authorization) is <i>hard</i> even without factoring in state adversaries.<p>The fact that the web-of-trust hasn&#x27;t succeeded doesn&#x27;t mean that another model won&#x27;t but I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for PGP to throw out the one goal it already does incredibly well (securing communications) in order to focus on the biggest problem we haven&#x27;t been able to solve in 20 years.

0,&gt; Correct-conception #1: steep learning curve<p>I was fortunate to learn vi by rote in a series of lectures where there was no computer in the room. Yep copying the likes of &#x27;:wq&#x27; from the hand-written blackboard to A4 paper along with all of the other &#x27;handy&#x27; commands some of which such as &#x27;yank&#x27; I do not use to this day. This was a whole different way of learning with the notes referred to rather than things getting &#x27;Googled&#x27;. Was this a better way to learn vi?<p>I don&#x27;t meet so many &#x27;vi&#x27; experts these days if anything I feel embarrassed to be using &#x27;vi&#x27; and associated command line tools like &#x27;grep&#x27; when everyone else has some auto-completing high-speed IDE instead. I have to &#x27;psr-fix&#x27; my code to make it sufficiently elegant. The problem for me is that I can do most things in &#x27;vi&#x27; without having to hunt around for menus etc. Therefore moving to the new is hard for me. In some ways I am like a secretary knowing &#x27;Wordperfect&#x27; 25 years ago and unable to adapt to &#x27;MS Word 2.0c&#x27; due to the same UI problem and convenience of known tools (Wordperfect Vim).<p>I also do not feel that &#x27;vi&#x27; works well in a team people with Mac-gui-loveliness computers just can&#x27;t edit things on your computer on an ad-hoc basis some visual editor has to be found just for them.<p>If you are a vim person then these funny new-fangled &#x27;gui&#x27; editors are really dangerous. It is far to easy for the document to end up with mystery &#x27;j&#x27; characters added to the first line &#x27;:wq!&#x27; added somewhere at the end maybe with some randon &#x27;ijk&#x27;s&#x27; in the middle. If you are a vim person then every editor should have an &#x27;insert&#x27; and &#x27;normal&#x27; mode not just &#x27;insert&#x27;. The rest of the world doesn&#x27;t see that though.<p>With people that do use &#x27;vim&#x27; I have noticed that everyone does things differently. Some people will regularly use a feature that you never use to make you wonder why you don&#x27;t know that trick. Life without the correct personalised &#x27;.vimrc&#x27; file is also quite hard however I have found some of these that others use to be overly &#x27;souped up&#x27; for instance the search I really do not like the search-as-you-type option old-school is better where you need to press enter.<p>So everyone finds their own dialect of &#x27;vim&#x27;. Like car drivers everyone thinks they are a good &#x27;vim driver&#x27; apart from those that haven&#x27;t learnt to drive. And they shouldn&#x27;t. Amazing that vim is it is a relic of former times there are better tools with better &#x27;UX paradigms&#x27;. In my field none of the &#x27;programming gods&#x27; use &#x27;vim&#x27; as they can&#x27;t get to their productivity levels with it so they use modern IDE&#x27;s for their work retaining enough &#x27;vim&#x27; for any server side config file editing.

0,It&#x27;s disappointing to see that the biggest &quot;disruption&quot; in the logistics space involves shifting risk further down the economic hierarchy. The most difficult part of last-mile logistics has been capacity planning both human and infrastructure. And yet much of this risk is now being pushed down to the entities least capable of absorbing it - what is the opportunity cost of being &quot;available&quot; as a DoorDash driver for a given shift with non-guaranteed compensation?<p>The message that is emerging loudly from the SV VC community is that they believe this model is one that should be pursued aggressively. Let&#x27;s be clear that in terms of labor and risk management this is not innovation it is a return to the status quo of a century ago - one that we as a society fought hard to change.<p>I fear that the plan is to just fight the legal and PR battles and hope that the robots arrive fast enough and make the situation moot (aka the Foxconn gambit).

0,It&#x27;s certainly very attractive to try to make other people more happy when that means that we can squeeze more juice out of them.<p>It seems we finally have enough <i>stuff</i> and comforts[1] to be able to question what exactly we need more of in order to find fulfilment. That seems like a relatively recent shift. And some people - for themselves - are finding that instead of pursuing things that might <i>one day</i> fulfil you they can instead try to find things that fulfil them right now. And not in the sense of drugs or anything like that; it might be just an ordinary education and eventually an ordinary career. But it has more to do with letting yourself try to enjoy the journey instead of pining for &quot;finally finishing college&quot; or &quot;finally getting that raise&quot; or &quot;finally retiring&quot;.<p>I think that if we see a massive shift towards <i>happiness</i> society might look from the outside as being quite the same and most people&#x27;s lives will look &quot;mediocre&quot;. But the difference will be in how people appreciate everything around them instead of being annoying obstacles towards an ever-moving goal.<p>[1] Maybe we had enough 30-40 years ago compared to today.

I&#x27;ve heard of doctrines of &quot;man has stewardship over the earth&quot; in the sense of all nature being for man&#x27;s use and also doctrines of &quot;God will provide&quot; and thus that overpopulation cannot be a significant issue. but I haven&#x27;t heard official statements of the &quot;use everything up before the Second Coming as a moral imperative&quot; before.

0,&gt; XML was originally simple too with just DTD as Schema.<p>The complexity of XML has not changed since its inception.<p>&gt; Then they come up with XML-RPC XMLSchema XSLT SOAP and many other complex concepts that in the end more or less failed.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really has any bearing on the specification of XML itself. XML is simple (with some caveats like entity expansion) and extremely flexible. The problem is that it is designed to be read and written by machines while still being debugable by people. It is extremely verbose. It shines in some use cases eg for documents with a complex structure and a lot of semantic metadata. But it is even less suitable than JSON for configuration files for instance.

Basically prior to ES6 Javascript engines did not prescribe the use of IANA (nee Olson) tzdata to resolve historic dates.<p>The standard says: &quot;The implementation of ECMAScript should not try to determine whether the exact time was subject to daylight saving time but just whether daylight saving time would have been in effect if the current daylight saving time algorithm had been used at the time. This avoids complications such as taking into account the years that the locale observed daylight saving time year round.&quot;<p>In Spidermonkey at least it mapped current years onto prior years where the current day falls on the same day of the week.<p>edit: Spidermonkey bug I filed a long time ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1029923" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1029923</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;es5.github.io&#x2F;#x15.9.1.8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;es5.github.io&#x2F;#x15.9.1.8</a>

Before that the conflict was called a conflict between arabs and jews and didn&#x27;t even involve the concept of a palestinian right to have its own nation.<p>And it&#x27;s fine with me i don&#x27;t mind palestinian arabs defining themselves as a people and wanting an independant state. Just don&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been there forever and is therefor the only legitimate political construct for the area.

Post it to 4chan?  Uh no.<p>What about ongoing undercover investigations?  Post it?<p>You accidentally shoulder-surf sensitive credentials -- bank manager&#x27;s login nuclear plant access code whatever.  Post them online?<p>Simple ways to make highly dangerous weapons drugs poisons etc. can also be info hazards.<p>It&#x27;s honestly not that hard to imagine real-life examples without having the dangerous info in question or descending into government assassin-type scenarios.<p>It&#x27;s just any data that if you make it generally available will predictably result in bad things happening.<p>In some cases -- like revealing important security flaws -- a public disclosure may be a last resort if less harmful methods have failed but it&#x27;s likely not an ethical <i>first</i> resort in those cases.

The web would be better off if all such sites went away leaving only the sites that provide a &quot;web presence&quot; for a real business and the sites of those people who have something to present and the money to put it out there.</i><p>You&#x27;re missing the probably most valuable kind of sites - those that are there to provide information. Not everything on this planet runs around making money - most of the time whatever runs around it is probably shit.<p>The things that are actually valuable for people - like Wikipedia like articles from domain specialists are usually free and supported by either donations said specialist&#x27;s own pockets or by some other mechanism <i>that doesn&#x27;t include authors profiting from the information they publish</i>.<p>That&#x27;s why when you want to learn something about well anything you go to subreddits or to Hacker News and view the comments and not the articles. Or you visit bloggers that don&#x27;t run said blogs as their primary occupation. Because all that content is created for free out of people&#x27;s spare time in order to help one another. People running business charging you for their articles? It&#x27;s them who have an agenda and you can easily see it reflected in the low quality and trustworthiness of said articles.

That is I&#x27;m interested in innovations or developments like IoT or blockchain or HTTP&#x2F;2 and innovative ways to utilize them. Generally I&#x27;m not interested in something like the latest MacBook Air; it&#x27;s significant in the marketplace but for my purposes it only marginally improves and repackages existing tech.

I&#x27;m also skeptical that your average company would have the expertise to write a good set of rules. So I was interested to see that &quot;half&quot; of an IDS tool.<p>I think the real answer is that it truly is just a rolling packet dump and it&#x27;s up to you to use it however you choose.<p>I can think of uses outside of network security: capturing traffic from your mobile devices on your home network (maybe this is just IDS if you&#x27;re watching for the contents of your address book to be exfiltrated by a malicious app) or snooping on people through a Internet cafe library or other  (small) open network that you administer.<p>For these uses just like IDS you&#x27;d want to run offline jobs against the data. Whether that&#x27;s a full scan for something interesting or an indexing pass that extracts (portions?) into a more easily viewable form.

0,A union negotiates a contract with an employer. The employer freely enters that contract and by signing that contract is giving the written intention of following through with that contract.<p>That contract is mutually beneficial. As employer you are provided with a pool of selected professionals. As a worker you are provided with fairer compensation and benefits.<p>Right to work comes in and says those contracts do not have to be honored by the employer and they can break that contract because the law says so. Anyone they employ now enjoys the benefits of that the union spent time and money on negotiating but the worker does not have to pay dues to enjoy that privilege. Without the union those privileges  wouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>Any &quot;rational actor&quot; can see that the rational decision is to enjoy the benefits a union brings to the table without having to pay dues.<p>The counter to this is the argument of freedom of association saying employers can hire who they want. This sidesteps the fact that employers made the free decision to entire such contracts and chose to stand by its stipulations.<p>Unions do not hold a monopoly on workers. Workers are free to entire and exit contracts with unions or negotiate on their lonesome. Employers have a variety of unions and individuals to pick their employees from.

0,&gt; what if mobile carriers where not allowed to discriminate whom they could sell zero-rated services to so each service provider&#x2F;app should have the freedom to choose the business model that works best for themselves?<p>While nominally better it would just be like putting lipstick on a pig. There would also be serious real world problems with actually enforing such a regimen.<p>&gt; what if 3rd parties where allowed to buy zero-rated URLs or IPs in &quot;bulk&quot; from all the carriers in a geography making it much easier to contract all mobile carriers?<p>My answer is pretty much the same as above only this one is a bit more ambitious. It&#x27;s basically like suggesting world peace as a solution to global conflicts. Getting all the carriers in a geographic region on board implementing rolling out and enforcing such a thing would almost be an effort worth a Nobel price in itself.<p>&gt; preventing companies to provide zero-rated services increases the digital divide as it inhibit people who cannot afford to buy a data plan to use services. In many areas of the world the majority of mobile consumers are on pre-paid plans and have zero credits most of the time (most countries have calling party pays so a smartphone with zero credit is still very valuable to receive calls)<p>Offering zero rating as a solution to this problem is a false choice. Zero rating is providing a means of communication for free AND limiting what it can be used for. The correct choice is to provide the same means of communications for free and NOT limiting what it can be used for. That is how you remove the digital divide.<p>If need be this free mode of communication can be limited by speed or by amount as is customary in the mobile world. What is not reasonable is to limit what can be done with it.<p>TL;DR zero rating is evil give users a free tier or quota instead.

But wouldn&#x27;t you rather use a simpler protocol that you could implement fully without having to worry about subtle errors sneaking in because you parsed the request line slightly wrong or because your proxy decides to send two X-Forwarded-For headers instead of one.<p>If you&#x27;re writing in Java or C++ you&#x27;ll be able to find a mature HTTP library that handles all of this for you but if for whatever reason I were writing from scratch I&#x27;d take a limited-purpose protocol like FastCGI any day.

0,&gt; Utilitarianism -- and many others -- are equally possible.<p>You misunderstand the dichotomy. This is not about what we can do humans can delude themselves all the time. The question is about what is logically consistent.<p>&quot;That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence&quot; applies in a purely natural universe which means that if there is no God we can dismiss Utilitarianism (and all the others) as there is no evidence for it. Only if the universe is supernatural (if God exists) do things change.

Basically taking control out of founders&#x27; hands VC risk ending up with bigger share of less successful company.

As they say at the end<p>&quot;For example Stewart says that because men have joined the profession more recently women tend to be more senior nurses. But as such they get to work preferred day shifts even though night and weekend shifts tend to pay more.<p>Peter McMenamin a health economist at the American Nurses Association says that while ANA policy &quot;is that there should be pay equity&quot; he&#x27;s not convinced the problem is as large as the study suggests. For one thing he says with so many women compared to men in the study the numbers for women &quot;are much more precise.&quot;&quot;<p>Essentially men might get the less desirable night shift that pays more and also the numbers for men might not be precise because its a lower sample size.<p>I worked in a hospital lab and the night differential was around 3-4 dollars more per hour a big deal when your base pay was 15-20 dollars per hour.

0,The Swedish&#x2F;Nordic Model just means that women in the industry aren&#x27;t directly criminalised for having sex for money (so long as they have the legal right to work in the country). It still makes it illegal for women to take safety measures like hiring a bouncer or driver to protect them from violent clients or working together with another woman for the same reason. It also makes it a criminal offence to knowingly rent a flat to a prostitute. It&#x27;s almost exactly the opposite of harm reduction - it makes it legal to sell sex but only in ways that are high risk. Hell I&#x27;ve seen activists in the UK who see this as a positive because the added danger will encourage women to leave the industry.

However I would be happy to support video creators with my wallet and they would probably make more money that way since I never click ads (so they get CPM revenue only).<p>When I think about watching TV when I was younger the details of the shows themselves have faded but the small but constant miseries of ad breaks are relatively vivid.  Sure the show was good enough to leave an overall positive impression or else I wouldn&#x27;t be watching it - although I am sure this is part of the reason I watched relatively little TV - but pleasure and annoyance don&#x27;t just cancel out; they remain in the mind as parallel memories each with its own effect.  Today I only watch TV on paid video services that lack ads and it continues to surprise me just how enjoyable a &#x27;clean high&#x27; without interruptions is.  Instead of my interest level rollercoastering up as the show plays sharply down as the ads start playing - ending just before it&#x27;s gotten low enough for me to abandon ship - it just goes up at the beginning and stays there until the end of the episode.<p>YouTube videos are different from TV shows of course - they&#x27;re typically much shorter and each viewed as only one element out of many in a session of Internet sensory overload where no one piece of content lasts long enough to engender the level of concentration characteristic of most other types of activities.  When there&#x27;s constant context switching an additional switch for an ad isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m okay with it especially when there&#x27;s an different possible compensation structure that in theory better rewards both me and the creator.

0,This is actually a somewhat controversial claim academically. There&#x27;s pretty strong evidence for a &quot;critical period&quot; for acquiring a native-sounding accent and some evidence that certain adult learners still occasionally mess up minor grammatical details after decades of immersion. But other studies suggest that language-learning ability trails off gradually with age in much the same way that say physical ability does. A 35-year-old can still get in pretty good shape if they work at it.<p>I know plenty of people whose language-learning strategy is basically &quot;Put myself in situations where I need to use the language and I can puzzle things out. If I get curious maybe look something up once in a while.&quot; It&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> like childhood acquisition but neither is it a completely different process.

0,I was born in 1983 so that puts me at the leading edge of what I think most people classify as millennials but honestly what you&#x27;re saying doesn&#x27;t resonate strongly with me. I can (and have recently) lived without a car but not for any of the reasons you cite. Instead it comes down to (a) parking is a pain in the ass in downtown Seattle and (b) if I drive somewhere I avoid drinking while I&#x27;m there so driving is a no-go for shows parties or even most evenings out with friends. Both of these are solved pretty thoroughly by Uber and (rarely) public transit. I don&#x27;t tend to use my phone when I&#x27;m moving between places unless I&#x27;m running late or someone pings me; I&#x27;m much more likely to sit back and just watch the world go by.<p>That said I do own a car primarily for my daily commute and weekend outings up to the mountains. In terms of safety environmental friendliness or cost effectiveness none of these factored at all into the decision for me. That said I drive a Tesla so it&#x27;s chock full of modern safety features (protecting me; for pedestrians it&#x27;s a silent rolling death machine with 691 horsepower) and I could argue that it&#x27;s less environmentally unfriendly than other cars but I bought it because it looked fun not for either of those reasons :)

An immigration lawyer while not necessary to do the paperwork (it&#x27;s pretty easy) should be able to give you a reasonable opinion as to whether you&#x27;d be successful or not.  They&#x27;re the only people that deal with this often enough to have a feel for when an application might be successful or not.<p>Do some google searching on &quot;TN visa&quot; and &quot;web developer&quot; there are lots of stories out there that should give you a feel for what&#x27;s involved.

0,&gt; It&#x27;s American foreign policy that created anti-american Islamic extremism.<p>That&#x27;s a very reductionist analysis. The Muslim Brotherhood has existed since the 1920s. However it was a secular Marxist anti-colonialist ideology that was most successful in the Arab world for the next few generations. Then these secular Arab states lost the Six Day War and failed to provide either good governance or economic opportunities for their populations.<p>The reason that Islamists have become so powerful is that the governments of many Arab countries have proven themselves to be completely bankrupt. If you&#x27;re young (and the population pyramids in places like Egypt are very fat on the bottom) and you have very few economic opportunities and your society is incredibly corrupt then a radical change becomes very appealing particularly if the people advocating that change are seen as pure and uncorrupt. The fact that Islamist groups oppose the US is one aspect of their appeal but it&#x27;s really only one factor. The fact that Hezbollah and Hamas are actively opposing Israel while Egypt made peace with Israel in 79 is also a factor.

0,&quot;virtually no competition&quot;?<p>Title II was designed for phone-line utilities in the 1930s where there really was a total monopoly: you either got service from your single phone company or not at all.<p>For broadband most Americans had not one but <i>zero</i> options 20 years ago.<p>Now most have 2 or more wired options (cable and DSL) and 3 or more cellular-wireless options. Some have extra fiber cable or DSL options. Some have other wireless options in the unlicensed spectrum. (Most people have more broadband options than smart-phone OS options; should the iOS&#x2F;Android be federally-regulated as a software utility?)<p>There are certainly places where the options are too few and too expensive. But that&#x27;s a local issue often created by correctable local government errors. To say there&#x27;s &quot;virtually no competition… for most&quot; is a false claim lacking perspective.<p>Based on that false impression Title II puts every ISP even where there is competition under federal-review rules designed for the single-provider telephone monopoly of the mid-20th century. Utility-style regulation tends to lock-in incumbents: it doesn&#x27;t expand competition or options but rather gives up on competition and just tells the presumed-permanent &quot;monopolist&quot; what to do.
0,Not so much imperfect as deceptively irrelevant.<p>&quot;Growth&quot; has absolutely nothing useful to say about &quot;things getting better for society.&quot;<p>Things get better for society when jobs pay well high quality education is freely accessible talent and creativity are rewarded cost of entry for entrepreneurship is low and ecological support systems are stable.<p>There&#x27;s nothing even remotely difficult about measuring these factors.<p>&quot;Growth&quot; is just a convenient way to disguise increasing inequality and decreasing economic freedom for the majority of the population.<p>If the growth is never distributed it&#x27;s a useless metric.

Its almost as if some of the intelligence community leadership could possibly lack humility and believe they are infallible. There have been one or two cases in history where a lot of power combined with secrecy has led to bad decision-making.  Perhaps this is another example.

0,&quot;people live cleaner year by year&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not talking about cleanliness. That&#x27;s a quality of life factor but ultimately it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important. The important thing is supply mostly of energy.<p>(It&#x27;s also important to note that to a great extent the West has cleaned up its environment by outsourcing polluting industries to Asia Africa and South America.)<p>Last I checked we still got more than 80% of our energy from fossil fuels. That has changed very very little in the past 50 years. My grandparents drove a gasoline car my parents drove a gasoline car and I drive a gasoline car and the power grid where I live is powered by 60% natural gas and 15% coal. Where I grew up it was almost 100% coal same as it was three generations ago.<p>We were supposed to be driving EVs powered by fusion reactors by now.<p>If you&#x27;re rich you can buy solar panels and an EV and convince yourself there is no problem but until that stuff falls geometrically in price to the point that it achieves mass adoption it&#x27;s a luxury toy that will make no impact. Either that or the future will require that 90% of humanity be reduced to medieval subsistence-level poverty. That&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> the collapse some have predicted but I highly doubt that sort of neo-feudal civilization is going to go to the stars. So it counts for the Fermi Paradox. The universe may be filled with such small limited planet-bound intelligences.<p>I&#x27;m slightly encouraged by an apparent Moore&#x27;s Law in solar but storage is now the bottleneck. I&#x27;m also very cynical about technological advancement outside of IT and a few other narrow areas. I agree with Peter Thiel that basically all major technological advancement outside of computers and some biotech stopped around 1970. Cars planes power plants etc. are all basically the same today as they were then.

But you can add new things and via mode switches (e.g. &quot;use strict&quot; which enables strict mode currently or &quot;use strong&quot; which is planned to enable strong mode) <i>essentially</i> remove old ones by disallowing them in the latest &quot;mode.&quot; Old code will continue to run but as long as you opt-in to the new way of doing things for your new code you can enforce not using the legacy constructs in the new code.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the modes are on a per-function basis so opting into the new mode doesn&#x27;t break existing libraries etc even if you call those libraries from a newer mode.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that <i>strong mode doesn&#x27;t introduce anything new.</i> All that strong mode does is remove features. `let` and `var` both already exist; in strong mode only `let` does.

0,That&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t need movement to stabilize your thinking and that expense of glucose depletes your resources. My experience is that ADHD kids need some sensori-motor input to help them reach their cognitive baseline.However I don&#x27;t agree with the study&#x27;s conclusion because it tested a sort of &quot;carpet-bombing&quot; approach to the problem (i.e. lots of movement  injection of endorphins).I think that a much more efficient way and I believe more durable also would be rock-climbing because in addition to the physical expense (i.e. energy output) it also stimulates very powerfully concentration&#x2F;focus and the zones of the brain associated with it (i.e somewhere in the pre-frontal cortex) and can actually teach concentration and focus.I even wonder whether the best rock-climbers are not self-medicated ADHDs rather than so-called &quot;adrenaline-junkies&quot;. Jumping off a bridge gushes adrenaline system-wide climbing a face does not.

0,The key phrase in his statement is &quot;unless otherwise specified&quot;.  Whenever an enterprise is dealing with a supplier -- and it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s software electronic componentry services or anything else -- there is no such thing as an acceptable boilerplate contract or TOS... that is unless the supplier is bigger than you and refuses to negotiate.  Apple is notorious for bullying their suppliers for example and Foxconn has gone so far as to purchase their own iron mine in order to control as much of their supply chain as possible.  It typically takes 4-6 different groups (I feel like all this should be and probably is documented somewhere... like every company&#x27;s sales manual.  You end up talking with the manager whose group requires the service&#x2F;product someone above or parallel to them as a sanity check someone in the company&#x27;s supplier management team someone in the accounts payable org (to get your banking &amp; credit details) someone in Legal to review contracts a stamp of approval from one or multiple execs and then finally whomever has to input the purchase request.) within an enterprise looking at it to get an approvable contract and then another week or two to figure out whose signature it needs to have.<p>As long as money is flowing and there is no obvious abuse no one really complains an regulators don&#x27;t get involved.  The wheels of commerce and all that.<p>Perhaps more apropos is the answer to a different version of your question regarding a different EU directive: EU 95&#x2F;46&#x2F;ec (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;LexUriServ&#x2F;LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:...</a>).  This directive covers data protection and proscribes quite a few things that make licensing or operating SAAS services challenging in the EU.  Some enterprises take the tack that &quot;well Safe Harbor covers us.&quot; and do whatever they want.  Others are ultra-conservative and refuse to use SAAS services that aren&#x27;t explicitly compliant with 95&#x2F;46&#x2F;EC.  And since it&#x27;s a directive and not actually a law in any country (except perhaps maybe slightly Sweden... which is also quite a bizarre situation having a FB data center there and all) it&#x27;s clear as mud how it would actually be enforced or what enforcement would look like.<p>To close I will tell you that The Street looks very closely at the payables&#x2F;receivables numbers &amp; ratio just like they care about inventory turns and other supply chain metrics.  It&#x27;s a big and bad deal when a large enterprise <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> pay more slowly than they receive payment (in aggregate).<p>I could tell a lot of stories but that would be ... career limiting.

My example was supposed to illustrate this but it actually has a bug.  I thought buttons didn&#x27;t get centered by text-align but they do.  Here&#x27;s an updated example:<p><pre><code>    &lt;table style=&#x27;height: 100%; width: 100%&#x27;&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=center valign=center&gt;	&lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;	The following green square should be centered:&lt;br&gt;        &lt;div style=&#x27;width: 30px; height: 30px; background: green&#x27;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;      &lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;table&gt;</code></pre>margin:auto also requires you to manually set the width of the div you&#x27;re trying to center in order to work.

0,Stories like this make me feel ambivalent.<p>Gender inequality being brought to the forefront fairly commonly has definitely forced me to evaluate my own actions and words. It sounds silly (and it is because it&#x27;s mostly beneficial) but I certainly treat female colleagues differently: I&#x27;m much more thoughtful about what I say and do and try to be as explicit as possible if I think there&#x27;s any way that my words&#x2F;actions could be misconstrued. Thoughtful in a way that I&#x27;m absolutely not around male colleagues.<p>And maybe that&#x27;s totally fine: I really doubt I&#x27;ll ever regret being <i>more</i> thoughtful. I certainly do this to some extent with people from other cultural backgrounds so applying it to people from other gender backgrounds (so-to-speak) is probably appropriate.<p>But it does absolutely setup this &quot;othering&quot; in my mind - I don&#x27;t see Jennifer as just my coworker she&#x27;s my coworker and she&#x27;s also a woman and I need to be cognizant of how I act and talk around her. I&#x27;m careful to think about my words and actions before they materialize whereas with men I&#x27;m much more likely to just act&#x2F;talk and explain later if necessary. &quot;Asking permission&quot; vs. &quot;Seeking forgiveness&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t envy being John Doerr - unless Pao was an absolutely clear frontrunner for becoming a senior partner you&#x27;re damned if you do and damned if you don&#x27;t.

0,I think a major differentiator is that in the EU credit cards are a lot less common and even debit cards aren&#x27;t used for most transactions (e.g. even at the supermarket most people seem to pay cash). Additionally there are € 1 and € 2 coins notes only start at € 5 and up. So you not only carry around a lot of cash but you also generally need to be able to carry around a lot of coinage too.<p>This has been the only thing stopping me from getting a smaller wallet personally. I have one of those (which are okay if you carry them in your front pocket and don&#x27;t wear formal attire) and I&#x27;d replace them with something simpler at the drop of a hat if it wouldn&#x27;t mean ending up with loose change in your pocket.

0,Wasn&#x27;t sure which reply to reply to so I&#x27;ll reply one level up. Everyone&#x27;s more or less right about the conservation of matter argument here but everyone commenting is missing the <i>aquifers</i> and they&#x27;re the key. Aquifer water is pure and clean lovely and ancient. It&#x27;s trickled down into its cracks between rocks over thousands and millions of years.<p>When California growers tap into aquifers to grow their almond-beef-whatever they&#x27;re not using a renewable resource. They&#x27;re using a very finite resource. The aquifers in CA are in real danger of tapping out. Why do we care?<p>1) it takes a huge amount of infrastructure to move around surface water<p>2) it takes a huge amount of infrastructure to clean surface water whether we&#x27;re just taking out the antibiotic residue and dirt and THC or desalinating<p>3) the cost of this transportation and purification infrastructure will dramatically impact where people can live and grow their food.<p>Moreover aquifer depletion has some funky effects. Sinkholes in Florida that swallow houses come from aquifer depletion -- the ground there is riddled with holes that really need to full of water if you want to support weight [1]. Some lakes start draining if they&#x27;re (somewhat unusually) geologically linked to a declining aquifer like White Bear Lake in Minnesota [2]. Part of the culprit in MN is that people can drill wells and use up to 10000 gallons per day <i>without a permit</i>. Switching to surface water is an option in the Midwest and the municipalities mentioned in MN are thinking about switching to Mississippi river water. But in central California what surface water are you going to use?<p>Last for the self-interested aquifer water often makes the best beers :)<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;27659-florida-sinkhole.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;27659-florida-sinkhole.html</a>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minnpost.com&#x2F;cityscape&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;why-white-bear-lake-shrinking-angry-residents-blame-dnr" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minnpost.com&#x2F;cityscape&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;why-white-bear-lak...</a>

There&#x27;s no pay gap between genders the pay gap is between women who never married and women who have married at some point regardless of present status.<p>Something else he gets wrong is this &quot;under representation in high paying jobs&quot; canard. That&#x27;s bad approximation again. The under-representation is in thing-oriented jobs versus relationship-oriented jobs. In Sweden in all their equality we still see mostly male engineers and mostly female nurses. It just happens that thing-oriented jobs pay more.

[1]</code></pre>My translation:<p><pre><code>    Under the current copyright law both download     as well as  upload are copyright infringement and    as such in principle punishable.     and some allow downloading because otherwise clicking     on a link might already incriminate you. </code></pre>In Germany it does.The most prominent case so far was when in 2013 the law firm Urmann + Collegen sent a large number of cease and desist letters to people thatused a popular adult video portal. They obtained the IP addressesfrom ads they allegedly published themselves. This was major news in Germany.<p>The reason it doesn&#x27;t happen more often is that going against Torrent usersis much easier and less risky for the law firm. Urmann + Collegen went bankrupt in 2014 from the fall out of this case but this is the exception.<p>I don&#x27;t have a number for 2013but in 2011 the mentioned law firm alone sent 70000 cease and desist letters amounting 90 million Euro.<p><pre><code>    What k___ is saying is that it&#x27;s the illegal upload part that moves     people away from torrent.</code></pre>I understood but that&#x27;s not relevant for Germany.

Newer codecs tend to do better than MP3 and at lower bitrates. The only point in lossy encoding is to save space so it makes sense to do it as efficiently as possible and considering that 320 CBR is actually the worst of both worlds because it always wastes space and is often overkill anyway.<p>An AAC file from a good implementation of the encoder (e.g. Apples or either from Fraunhofer including the Open Source FDK-AAC from Android) will usually (for most people with most music) achieve transparency in the mid to high hundreds of kbps.<p>The material listened to always makes a difference therefore unqualified arguments about &quot;can always tell&quot; or &quot;never can tell&quot; are always flawed.

(I maintain an HTML parser [1] that&#x27;s still on 0.9.3 and yet is more robust and better tested than one that is on 3.8.2.)  Is this actually the case with Rakudo though?

0,The brilliant thing about the Apple Watch is that no matter which casing&#x2F;strap you buy <i>you&#x27;re getting the same gear</i>. So if you don&#x27;t care what the watch is made of or how it looks you can just buy the Sport model. If you want the best durability you get the steel&#x2F;sapphire standard model. If you want the blingiest thing you get the Edition. But no matter how much you spend you get the same functionality. This isn&#x27;t a matter of Apple selling an elites-only product. This is Apple bringing a mainstream product to the elite market.

0,This article was fantastically well written and comprehensive. Worth reading if you&#x27;re interested at all in the topic of automation and its potential effects on the future of employment.<p>The narrative that machines will &quot;eat&quot; all the jobs leaving the mass of humanity unemployed is an easy to understand story but it hasn&#x27;t ever come to pass and probably won&#x27;t for reasons that don&#x27;t need to be detailed in this comment. The nobel laureate Robert Solow compared it to worrying about the earth being struck by an asteroid. Possible even worth consideration but highly unlikely.<p>The idea that machines will dominate labor to the point where a few rich people gain all the profits from labor and the rest of us are left jobless and effectively under their control is equally unlikely. A gem from the article:<p><i>&quot;Capital isn’t just winning against labour: there’s no contest. If it were a boxing match the referee would stop the fight.&quot;</i><p>Income inequality is probably the biggest problem facing our society today. But it can only go so far. If the majority of people don&#x27;t have jobs no one will be able to pay for new iphones or driverless car service fees. Even B2B companies depend on B2C customers for revenue at some point in the chain. The basic common sense economics of the world dictate that there are limits to inequality. The idea that machines will create a truly dystopian scenario is still the realm of science fiction but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t take steps to address the problem.<p>Finally I loved this quote:<p>&quot;Robert Gordon an American economist who in 2012 published a provocative and compelling paper called ‘Is US Economic Growth Over?’ in which he contrasted the impact of computing and information technology with the effect of the second industrial revolution between 1875 and 1900 which brought <i>electric lightbulbs</i> and the <i>electric power station</i> the internal combustion engine the telephone radio <i>recorded music</i> and <i>cinema</i>.&quot;<p>Worth noting that four of those seven inventions were created by one man. Not relevant to the topic of automation just truly freaking amazing.

No evidence in either direction so far as I know. And given the nature of physics at Plank scales it might be impossible to devise an experiment which could distinguish between them.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case it would mean it&#x27;s not wrong (and not right either) to declare that the universe is discrete meaning all measure are in fact rational numbers.

Societal change is more effectively influenced through social representation and there are many avenues to achieve that but I don&#x27;t believe creating software in an office space is the most effective one.<p>I wish things could be different but without financial freedom we are destined to build what other people deem valuable.
