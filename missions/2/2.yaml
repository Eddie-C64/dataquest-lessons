  We have a csv file containing movie reviews.  Each row in the dataset contains the text of the review, and whether the tone of the review was classified as positive(`1`), or negative(`-1`).

  We want to predict whether a review is negative or positive given only the text.  In order to do this, we'll train an algorithm using the reviews and classifications in `train.csv`, and then make predictions on the reviews in `test.csv`.  We'll then be able to calculate our error using the actual classifications in `test.csv`, and see how good our predictions were.

  For our classification algorithm, we're going to use [naive bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).  A naive bayes classifier works by figuring out the probability of different attributes of the data being associated with a certain class.  This is based on [bayes' theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).  The theorem is $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)}$$.  This basically states "the probability of A given that B is true equals the probability of B given that A is true times the probability of A being true, divided by the probability of B being true."

  Let's do a quick exercise to understand this rule better.

  Let's try a slightly different example.  Let's say we still had one classification -- whether or not you were tired.  And let's say we had two data points -- whether or not you ran, and whether or not you woke up early.  Bayes' theorem doesn't work in this case, because we have two data points, not just one.

  This is where naive bayes can help.  Naive bayes extends bayes' theorem to handle this case by assuming that each data point is independent.

  The formula looks like this: $$P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)}{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}$$.  This is saying "the probability that classification y is correct given the features $$x_1$$, $$x_2$$, and so on equals the probability of y times the product of each x feature given y, divided by the probability of the x features".

  To find the "right" classification, we just find out which classification ($$P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n)$$) has the highest probability with the formula.

  We're trying to determine if a data row should be classified as negative or positive.  Because of this, we can ignore the denominator.  As you saw in the last code example, it will be a constant in each of the possible classes, thus affecting each probability equally, so it won't change which one is greatest (dividing 5 by 2 and 10 by 2 doesn't change the fact that the second number is bigger).

  So we have to calculate the probabilities of each classification, and the probabilities of each feature falling into each classification.

  We were working with several discrete features in the last example.  Here, all we have is one long string.  The easiest way to generate features from text is to split the text up into words.  Each word in a review will then be a feature that we can then work with.  In order to do this, we'll split the reviews based on whitespace.

  We'll then count up how many times each word occurs in the negative reviews, and how many times each word occurs in the positive reviews.  This will allow us to eventually compute the probabilities of a new review belonging to each class.

name: Making predictions
type: code

  Now that we have the word counts, we just have to convert them to probabilities and multiply them out to get the predicted classification.  Let's say we wanted to find the probability that the review `didn't like it` expresses a negative sentiment.  We would find the total number of times the word `didn't` occured in the negative reviews, and divide it by the total number of words in the negative reviews to get the probability of x given y.  We would then do the same for `like` and `it`.  We would multiply all three probabilities, and then multiply by the probability of any document expressing a negative sentiment to get our final probability that the sentence expresses negative sentiment.

  We would do the same for positive sentiment, and then whichever probability is greater would be the class that the review is assigned to.

  To do all this, we'll need to compute the probabilities of each class occuring in the data, and then make a function to compute the classification.

  # We need these counts to use for smoothing when computing the prediction.
  positive_review_count = get_y_count(1)
  negative_review_count = get_y_count(-1)

  # These are the class probabilities (we saw them in the formula as P(y)).

      # Now we multiply by the probability of the class existing in the documents.

  Now that we can make predictions, let's predict the probabilities on the reviews in `test.csv`.  You'll get misleadingly good results if you predict on the reviews in `train.csv`, because the probabilities were generated from it (and this, the algorithm has prior knowledge about the data it's predicting on).

  Getting good results on the training set could mean that your model is [overfit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting), and is just picking up random noise.  Only testing on a set that the model wasn't trained with can tell you if it's performing properly.

  Now that we know the predictions, we'll compute error using the area under the [ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_curve) curve.  This will tell us how "good" the model is -- closer to 1 means that the model is better.

  Computing error is very important to knowing when your model is "good", and when it is getting better or worse.

  There are a lot of extensions that we could make to this algorithm to make it perform better.  We could look at [n-grams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) instead of unigrams.  We could remove punctuation and other non-characters.  We could remove [stopwords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words).  We could also perform [stemming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) or lemmatization.

  We don't want to have to code the whole algorithm out every time, though.  An easier way to use naive bayes is to use the implementation in scikit-learn.  [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a python machine learning library that contains implementations of all the common machine learning algorithms.
